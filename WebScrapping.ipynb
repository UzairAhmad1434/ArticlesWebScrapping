Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. What are people using in the workforce? What do the trends look like? We’re not attempting to pick what’s best, but instead using a data-driven approach to help you focus on what might actually help you land a job when the interviewer asks you, “do you know __(fill in the blank)__?”\\nWe’re not going to look at which ones are the fastest, or which ones have the best code quality. We’ll assume they’re all speed demons and they’re all good enough to get the job done. The focus is on one thing: What’s actually being used at scale?\\nThe big question we’ll look at is the current state of component frameworks, and we’re going to focus primarily on the big three: React, Angular, and Vue.js, primarily because they have all broken far ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of workplace adoption.\\nLast year I noted how fast Vue.js was growing and mentioned it might catch Angular in 2018. That didn’t happen, but it’s still growing very quickly. I also predicted it would have a much harder time converting React users because React has a much stronger user satisfaction rate than Angular — React users simply don’t have a compelling reason to switch. That played out as expected in 2018. React kept a firm grip on its lead in 2018.\\nInterestingly, all three frameworks are still growing exponentially, year over year.',\n",

I’ve seen thousands of resumes, interviewed hundreds, and hired or helped hire dozens, so I’ll describe exactly what I’m looking for when I’m presented with your application.\\nIn the US, documents describing your qualifications and work history are called résumés. In the EU and elsewhere known as a curriculum vitae, or CV. Either way, the purpose is the same: a relatively short document which summarizes your skills, work history, education, contact information, and anything else that can be used to estimate your “fit” for a given position.\\nI’m based in the US, so I’ll give a US-centric view of resumes, but I’ll attempt to point out differences with CVs in areas in which I’m familiar.\\nA resume is required as part of almost every job application. If you see a job listing online and click “Apply,” the next page will almost certainly ask you for your contact information and a resume file. Yes, getting a job is a highly-subjective process that involves interviewing and negotiation, but providing an employer with a resume is the standard first step before any of that can happen.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Load testing is the process of putting the load through (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket etc) calls on any software system to determine its behavior under normal and high load conditions. Load test helps identify maximum requests a software system can handle. It helps determine the point of a bottleneck due to which application starts degrading performance. Load testing is effective when we simulate real user scenario. We need to know how our users behave on our application. Try to replicate their behavior using different API calls and generate load through many concurrent requests at our application for an extended period of time to understand application behavior changes.\\nWhen we generate load on the system beyond normal usage (high load) to understand application/system behavior, we call it stress testing. Stress testing is done to know the limits of an overall system, understand kind of errors thrown during such load and how the end user is affected. This helps in planning for events when a much higher load is expected by provisioning more infrastructure or optimizing applications.\\nWe can useApache JMeterfor load testing static as well as dynamic resources which can generate concurrent users to simulate real user scenario. It also provides graphical analyses of test reports. It is written in Java, so we need to have java runtime installed to run Jmeter. As perJMeter website, it is defined as mentioned below :\\nInstallJMeteron your system from where you want to run your test. I am using Mac OS for running Jmeter and using brew to install JMeter.\\nWe first need to check file descriptors we can open on our system using below command. Every OS has limits on active file descriptors. Every TCP connection takes a file descriptor, so we need to make sure we have enough file descriptor (can set between 1–65535) to run concurrent requests.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Black Mirroris a speculative-fiction anthology series created by Charlie Brooker that highlights the dark aspects of modern society, particularly as it relates to our relationship with technology. Each stand-alone episode paints a picture of a world that’s futuristic, yet believable; sleek, yet horrifying. Each of thesestudy guideswill examine the themes of a particular episode. All screencaps are mine.\\nWhen we first got word that 2018’s entry ofBlack Mirrorwould be “interactive” and a choose-your-own-adventure-style story, I laughed.Black Mirror, with the exception of episodes like “San Junipero”and “Hang the DJ,” is a very pessimistic show. So an episode said to allow you to make choices would undoubtedly be about the illusion of choice, free will, and control. WithBandersnatchnow released, that remains true.\\nRight off the bat, the first choice you’re presented with is between two breakfast cereals for Stefan. The second is a choice regarding what music Stefan listens to on the bus to Tuckersoft. They’re obviously small choices, serving more as a tutorial for the rest of the episode, a proof of concept that shows your choices will have material effect. Stefan’s fate is in your hands; you can determine how the story unfolds and ends.',\n",

But for a brief explanation, I will tell you several things.\\nI usually defend the argument that code without unit tests is dead code. Because, when a developer adds a new feature to some code which is not covered by a unit test, it is prone to override existing business rules (which kills the code written before). Maybe it’s not exactly prone to it, but you can imagine what errors can occur when a complex project needs to be changed. Unit testing is the only way to protect your code against breaking changes.\\nEvery time we write an endpoint we need to be sure several things work correctly. The endpoint should return the data in the correct structure and handle the request correctly. We can test it manually, which is not preferable. So we write unit tests to ensure that our endpoints work correctly. There is also another way for testing endpoints known as automation tests, but that is not the subject of this post.\\nIt should be clear already, but just in case: we need to be sure our business logic works correctly.',\n",

Here I won’t describe what events are as there are a lot of articles covering that topic (here is the perfect one). I’ll just say that typically we use events for some off-chain operations, for examples tracking token’s transfers or retrieving the filtered list of particular transactions, just like a good old SQL query.\\nLet’s suppose we want to make a website that tracks some token transfers, a kind of Etherscan. We definitely need such simple operations like:\\nWhat we have in web3 now isgetPastEventsmethod, the example usage of which is\\nThe main issue with this approach is it can be slow as blockchain grows, especially if you don’t run your own Ethereum node and use public providers like Infura or MyEtherApi.\\nThe next thing — it is almost impossible to implement some tricky queries as filter object’s functionality is quite limited.',\n",

The story really does start with recent innovations in machine learning, more specifically, the machine learning algorithms that support computer vision. Yes, you could go back further and delve into some of the work done during the last Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence “Winter” but that’s digging a bit deeper than we need to illustrate why the future of photography depends on these technologies.This CNET postcomes close to getting the point across on what the future impact of this technology might be but lacks some real-world examples.

       "  'article': 'Last month marked my five year anniversary as an investor. I first moved back to Los Angeles to join the world of venture capital in 2013, when the tech ecosystem in Southern California looked very different than it does today. Long time LA fund GRP Partners had justrebrandedas Upfront Ventures, moving its office from Century City to Santa Monica. The biggest recent exits were for Cornerstone OnDemand, Riot Games, and Demand Media. GQ had recently named Abbot Kinneythe coolest block in America, but the Snap-driven tech transformation of Venice was still in its infancy. Greater Southern California had a long history of building strong tech businesses, but still felt like it wasn’t living up to it’s full potential.\\nSince then, Southern California has been on a roll. Major exits for companies like Oculus VR, BlackLine, and Lynda.com have shown that Southern California can build successful companies in diverse industries. Greg Bettinelli’s list of SoCal investors hasexploded in length. And everybody in the Bay Area seems to be moving to SoCal, or at least talking about it. The trend continued with in 2018, in which Southern California saw a record number of unicorn financing rounds, several strong exits, and the emergence of what was arguably 2018’s hottest venture-backed company.\\nAccording to CB Insights (plus two possible additions of Fair and Seismic right at the finish line of the year), seven companies joined the Unicorn club in Southern California in 2018. Perhaps what is most notable about these companies is their diversity in industries. For years, naysayers downplayed Los Angeles startups in particular as being too focused on consumer and media markets, and lacking expertise in enterprise software or deep tech. In 2018’s unicorn batch we see industries ranging from healthcare to law to HVAC — no media or CPG this year. Santa Monica is heavily represented on the list, but the surprise runner up city was Glendale, which counts both LegalZoom and ServiceTitan as residents. Already home to the edtech unicorn Age of Learning, Glendale has quietly emerged as a major center for tech hiring in Southern California, far away from the hype of Venice or the laboratories of La Jolla.\\nBy far the biggest news story of 2017 for the Southern California tech ecosystem was the IPO of Snap. In just a little over five years from launching, the company had managed to change the way that teens communicate, build a serious competitor to Facebook’s social media dominance (spurning acquisition offers in the process), and turn the neighborhood of Venice on its head as at spread into every square foot of available office space. Shortly after Snap went public, many LA tech watchers were left wondering, what’s next?\\nPerhaps the theme of big SoCal exits in 2018 was perseverance. Santa Barbara-based Sonos finally went public in August, a full sixteen years after its founding. Carlsbad-based Luxtera announced a major acquisition by Cisco seventeen years after its founding. And Amazon acquired Santa Monica-based Ring, which Shark Tank investorspublicly rejectedon national television. These three exits showed that the vast majority of companies are not overnight successes, and they require time and patience to build in the face of constant detractors.',\n",

Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. What are people using in the workforce? What do the trends look like? We’re not attempting to pick what’s best, but instead using a data-driven approach to help you focus on what might actually help you land a job when the interviewer asks you, “do you know __(fill in the blank)__?”\\nWe’re not going to look at which ones are the fastest, or which ones have the best code quality. We’ll assume they’re all speed demons and they’re all good enough to get the job done. The focus is on one thing: What’s actually being used at scale?\\nThe big question we’ll look at is the current state of component frameworks, and we’re going to focus primarily on the big three: React, Angular, and Vue.js, primarily because they have all broken far ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of workplace adoption.\\nLast year I noted how fast Vue.js was growing and mentioned it might catch Angular in 2018. That didn’t happen, but it’s still growing very quickly. I also predicted it would have a much harder time converting React users because React has a much stronger user satisfaction rate than Angular — React users simply don’t have a compelling reason to switch. That played out as expected in 2018. React kept a firm grip on its lead in 2018.\\nInterestingly, all three frameworks are still growing exponentially, year over year.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Traveled to ten countries. Worked on three different teams at Microsoft. Got a puppy. Spoke at GHC.\\nWoah — this is thefifth editionof my year in review!! (See2014,2015,2016,2017) Feels crazy that five years have flown by. Below I’ll capture some of my favorite highlights of the year and goals for next year. This years post turned out to be a bit longer than previous ones!\\nI created a 1 second per day video this year! I missed a handful of days, usually mid-work week, but for the most part this shows every day of my year. I’ve already loved looking back on this probably a hundred times throughout the year — it brings me so much joy looking through the little moments and people that make day-to-day life so special. Check it out:\\nI’m so grateful for some of the places I’ve had the chance to visit and some of the highlights of the year, but I will preface this all by saying *most* of my days lately consist of working long hours (not seeing the sun and jumping between conference rooms, morning + afternoon coffees), coming home and taking care of Ollie or talking with Josiah, sometimes making dinner, and sometimes continuing to work from the couch. I don’t document these moments as much, but they make up the majority of my time. What most days look like:\\nA huge rollercoaster this year was switching teams within Microsoft. After close to ~30 interviews/coffee meetings I made the decision to switch from Skype to a Mixed Reality Incubation team. I started working on an educational VR project and also found out the entire org was going to be cut the first week I joined. Sensing the turmoil here, I was able to switch over to another team, Azure IoT, that I’m really excited about. This ended up being close to a 6 month process— prepping for interviews, interviews, wrapping up work, starting new work, everything falling apart, starting over again — I felt really behind and spent all my time outside of work dealing with figuring out work. However, it does feel like it was all worth it! I’m in a place now that is supportive, challenging, fast-paced, and with lots of opportunity. I’ve already learned a lot and am excited for the potential growth here.',\n",

As users cite “rejection discrimination” on mainstream platforms such as Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and OkCupid, several reactionary right-wing independent dating apps have begun flooding the market promising to deliver on these lustful safe spaces.

Some of the metrics, from the number of published papers and conference attendance, to mentions on corporate earnings calls and in parliamentary hearings, measure the hype.

       "  'article': 'By Kevin Buckland\\nToyota Motor Corp. has sold enough cars to put one outside every Japanese home. Now it wants to put robots inside.\\nWell-known for its automated assembly lines, Toyota sees a not-so-far-off future in which robots transcend the factory and become commonplace in homes, helping with chores — and even offering companionship — in an aging society where a quarter of the population is over 65 and millions of seniors live alone.\\nMachines have become much smarter in the last decade or so. Yet, every attempt to build one that can do simple things like load a washing machine or carry groceries encounters the same basic, physical problem: the stronger a robot gets, the heavier and more dangerous it becomes. What Toyota has going for it are $29 billion in cash reserves, a new artificial intelligence research center and a well-respected inventor, Gill Pratt, heading its effort.\\n“This is a company with so many resources that you can never ignore them,” said Morten Paulsen, a Tokyo-based analyst at CLSA Japan Securities Co., who’s covered the robotics industry for decades.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Carolyn Pioro used to be a trapeze performer for a Toronto-based circus. But, in 2005, she was tragically and terribly injured during training when she fell 40 feet and a landed badly on the safety net, severing her spinal cord. With her trapeze career cut short, she enrolled at Centennial College in a contemporary journalism program. She wanted to shoot a photo essay on the performance she loved, but was unable to find an accessible camera option that fit her needs. So,Taras Slawnych stepped in to create one for her.\\nSlawnych is maker, and the visual editor for the Toronto’s Star newspaper. He heard about Pioro’s situation from Star’s photographer Steve Russell, who is a friend of Pioro’s professor Tyler Anderson. Slawnych figured he could come up with a way for Pioro tosnap photos, and set out to build it. Because Pioro is quadriplegic, the camera needed to be completely hands free — not only the shutter release, but also panning and tilting.\\nThe device Slawnych came up with sits inside a3D-printedenclosure attached to Pioro’s wheelchair. It takes the 24V battery power from the wheelchair and steps it down to 12V to power the components. Those arean Arduino, servos, and microphone. By interpreting Pioro’s voice commands, the device can pan, tilt, and trigger the camera so she can shoot all the photos she likes on her own. Slawnych even took the device to Canon Canada, who has expressed interest in expanding the design to include zoom functionality.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Hello robot friends! It has been an action packed year for Robot Missions to say the least! From meeting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to having 100 participants be part of our Season Finale Field Test, to the progress on the robots functioning autonomously and with artificial intelligence.\\nWhat we accomplished this year was made possible in large part because of the support of the community.\\nI’ve always envisioned Robot Missions as a huge mountain that one desires to reach the summit of. Since the journey is a crucial part of the adventure, then the only legitimate way to reach the peak is to just keep climbing upwards. And we’ve made a few steps forward this year. At this vantage point, it is a privilege to see the steps that helped us reach this far.\\nGoing through the year might not have felt successful at times — perhaps more like drowning during portions of it. By partially emerging to take pause and look back, it’s evident that this year we’ve made a significant leap forwards in the big dream of Robot Missions.\\nOf course, there were mistakes and missteps made along the way. Undoubtedly, there were also sad moments this year. We will learn from these and strive to improve in 2019.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Organisations and individuals alike are realising that data — their data — has value. While data literacy has a long way to go, this is an important first step.\\nJudicious use of analytics can have a significant positive impact on individuals’ lives: think of better energy management, increased financial security, and improved medical decisions, to name just a few. On a societal level it can help mitigate environmental degradation, improve allocation of tax revenues, and define better policies and treaties, increasing overall happiness, transparency, and welfare. Analytics can simplify complexity.\\nIf you’re wondering why it doesn’t feel like these benefits are being realised, well,you’re not the only one. There are likely two factors at play here.\\nFirstly, we have difficulty at times recognising progress, instead amplifying the negative news while sidelining positive developments. If you’re interested in overcoming this bias I’d recommendFactfulness, theBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Annual Letters, and theNew York Times’ Week in Good News.\\nThe second factor is simpler: humans aren’t doing a great job yet at unlocking the promise of data, analytics, and AI. In certain areas we have seen an almost magical level of progress, e.g.machine translationandcomplex board games. However, in others we are only in our infancy, and many organisations are not realising the value they could, both due to technical and behavioural hurdles.',\n",

       "  'article': 'In early 2018 Netflix pulled the option to subscribe to their service through the Google Play store in order to bypass the share that Google takes of subscriptions. The decision left many assuming that the same fate would await their iOS app and indeed as 2018 ended so to did the option of subscribing to Netflix through the Apple App Store.\\nThis comes after many developers have voiced their upset over the percentage both Apple and Google take of any in-app purchase. Both companies used to take 30% but in more recent years cut that figure to 15%. Still tensions have remained high between developers and the two tech giants.\\nNetflix isn’t the first company to do this, it’s one of many. Spotify pulled the option to subscribe in-app on iOS. Amazon limits movie and tv-show rentals through Prime Video to its website; Purchasing Kindle books isn’t available through their Kindle app either. Epic Games opted to release Fortnite on Android purposely not on the Google Play store to avoid Google taking a cut on in-game purchases.\\nSo just how much are companies like Apple and Google profiting off of these subscriptions? Netflix on iOS was grossing approximately $2.4 million a day in 2018, Apple’s cut would be around $700,000 of that figure.\\nAccording to Sensor Tower, to date Netflix has generated $1.5 billion in in-app subscriptions, meaning Apple took home a comfortable $450 million+. It’s not entirely surprising why these companies are opting for the less user-friendly options and it also makes you wonder whether any other apps on the top-grossing list will consider making the jump.',\n",

       "  'article': 'When I read about the tech trend predictions for 2019, I feel a strong sense of déjà vu. So many of them sound exactly like the future we envisioned five years ago. Big data is big business. AI is the new electricity, and smart machine learning algorithms will empower consumers, personalize their experience, and enable better decision-making. Self-driving vehicles will make mobility safer and more energy-efficient. Automation will cost jobs but also free many of us to pursue work that is purposeful and fulfilling. “Moonshot thinking,” combined with a Silicon Valley-style fail-fast culture, is the panacea to transforming organizations and entire societies. Human-centered design is the key to doing this in the most humane fashion. And eventually transhumanism will merge human and machine anyway and produce performances at unprecedented level, including achieving immortality.\\nSound familiar?\\nThis future fatigue is not the fault of futurists–they are just reading the tea leaves in their cups. But obviously, the future is not just unevenly distributed, it is also taking a really long time to arrive.\\nIncrementalism is the new disruption, and pragmatism the new moonshot.\\nIn this spirit, here are three tech trends that are not groundbreaking but may make or break your business in 2019. If you aren’t yet, this will be the year in which you ought to become exponential-tech-literate. Here’s the new ABC that you must master:',\n",

       "  'article': 'I’m starting a new tradition — writing annual New Year’s Eve posts. These will complement my birthday posts and hopefully everything else I write. Sometimes my writings will be brief, and at other times lengthier. Birthday posts are more reflective and centered about my own personal development and evolution while these posts will be more forward looking and touch on subjects well beyond the subjective. There will be some overlap, though, and I’m quite okay with that.\\nLast year’s New Year’s resolution was to have no resolution and live life with no particular goals or aims; to ‘do nothing.’ My intent was simply to take a break. I’d say I largely succeeded and an unplanned side effect was trading off productivity for awareness. I spent more time observing the world and those around me. I spent less time in my own head and more empathizing with others. I suspect dealing with unexpected death, loss, pain, and accidents that happen to have occurred this year was easier than it would have otherwise been in this frame of mind, though of course one can never really know.\\nIf I failed in trying to do nothing, it was in doing something. It turns out it’s really hard to do nothing. But let’s say for the sake of exposition that I sufficiently well approximated doing nothing, insofar as feasible. I ask that you grant me some latitude and that we just agree to call whatever I was doing ‘doing nothing.’\\nSomething funny happens when you’re ‘doing nothing.’ It’s almost like what happens when you eat nothing.\\nI’ve really taken to fasting because I enjoy the exercise of will power required to resist hunger. There may or may not be health benefits to this; I don’t know and frankly don’t care. I simply enjoy the feeling. The type of hunger that you experience after not eating for 48+ hours is very different from the hunger you feel when you skip a meal or are excessively stressed.',\n",

Em 1893 graduou-se no Smith College, em Northampton e, após ensinar matemática por dois anos em Denver e zoologia no Smith College por um ano, ela foi a primeira mulher a ser aceita na Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, no ano de 1896, onde construiu uma grande reputação por conta das suas pesquisas em embriologia e histologia. Florence se tornou uma anatomista, por isso acredito que a pergunta do início do texto lhe era muito recorrente.\\nUm outro grande feito de Florence Rena é que ela foi a primeira mulher eleita para a National Academy of Sciences e uma das primeiras mulheres médicas norte-americanas a construir carreira como pesquisadora.\\nEm 1900, recebeu o título de Doutora pela Johns Hopkins e em 1901 publicou “An Atlas of the Medulla and Midbrain”, um livro de texto sobre medicina que se tornou muito popular na época. No ano seguinte, a Johns Hopkins finalmente revogou sua política de não contratar mulheres e ela passou então a integrar o staff de pesquisadores. Destacou-se como pesquisadora do sistema linfático, onde reformulou a explicação tradicional do desenvolvimento do mesmo, provando que o desenvolvimento das veias no embrião ocorre fora em tecidos.\\nFoi ainda professora de histologia na Johns Hopkins University entre 1917 e 1925, e membro do Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research entre 1925 e 1938, onde se aposentou e tornou-se emérita. Voltou a morar em Denver, Colorado, onde trabalhou para o governo do estado.\\nUfa! Quanta coisa a Dra. Sabin fez e contribuiu para a ciência.

Everyone on earth is happy, motivated, enthusiast about something refreshing and so much positive vibe all around. Quarter of contacts are live on Instagram and others are also busy in writing digital history for their kids. Our WhatsApp message box is full of happy new year wishes and our mind is full of opportunity to look forward. Once Albert Einstein said :\\nLEARN from yesterday, LIVE for today, HOPE for tomorrow\\nLets see what I have in my list to look in 2019. Technology, Programming languages, Books, Traveling, Sports and many more thing. Here I am going to share some of hot stuff to watch.\\nAI gradually impacting in our life, The way we live, work, play and communicating to smart devices. AI is everywhere in modern lifestyle. We all are using some sort of AI which may include App assistance, chat bot, navigation services or smart Apps. The speed which we are going I won’t wonder if the 2024 presidential election in the USA will Siri vs Alexa or Cortona vs OK Google.\\nThe whole purpose of AI is to create intelligent machines. A machine which has problem solving power and can perform difficult and tedious task by own. A machine which can learn from the input provided and give some accurate outcome. AI can learn and perform by the given set of input, which turn into the model to the next result. AI is an essential toolfor problem solving. Machine learning and Robotics are also very important part of AI.',\n",

That’s the one real utility that Twitter has for me; it’s why I follow the diverse set of people I do in an attempt to avoid an echo chamber and be open to diverse and contrasting views, as annoying as this sometimes is.\\nI came across a tweet recently that tied together some fascinating threads of messy techno/human confluences for me — concepts where human nature, technology and ethics are colliding in an interesting and unexpected way: luck, self-driving cars and Chinese social credit scores.\\nIt suggestively questioned how awful it would be if self-driving cars in China were to use the reportedly planned Chinese “social credit system” to make the choice between who lives and who dies in accident situations. Presumably those with a “better” score get spared over those with a worse score, with the immediate proposition being that that would be awful. Perhaps it would be and, if I were a betting man, I’d put money onmostpeople thinking that it would be at least some flavour of unpleasant.\\nI wondered, would it actually be awful?

       "  'article': 'Ofall the table games at casinos, I’ve always had a preference for blackjack — in particular because if you play disciplined basic strategy and count cards and the casino doesn’t use a card shuffling machine but deals from a 6-deck shoe (plus another bunch of rules which I won’t go into detail with), you can get the odds to within 48.5% in favor of the player — meaning the house has its odds whittled down to 1.5% over a disciplined player. Mind you, I use the term “disciplined,” not “skilled.” That’s because anybody can be a decent blackjack player with discipline and hard work — which is why so few people do it — beyond a point, it becomes a job. Unfortunately, this particular evening I wasn’t playing in Vegas, or even Reno for that matter, but instead at the glitzy (not) “Integrated Resort” (but really it’s a casino) in Singapore — Marina Bay Sands. At the behest of some guests, I was playing a decent game at the blackjack table, enjoying some casual banter with my guests and some steely eyed ladies of leisure, when my phone buzzed indicating that a small transaction had been placed on my credit card to purchase train tickets at London’s Paddington Station. “Interesting,” I thought, “How did I buy those tickets from almost 7,000 miles away?” In an instant, I knew that my credit card had been compromised, but I wasn’t about to call the credit card company yet as…',\n",

Since then, INT team has carried out code refactoring and layering, developed an upgraded version of the chain which is more applicable for actual application scenarios in IoT, and released a global public beta version of the chain. After several months of R&D in core design, INT team successfully implemented a P2P network communication protocol, consensus algorithm, and smart contracts, and released a working testnet on 14th December 2018. At present, INT team is following up on feedback submitted by users and community to continue improving the main chain. Mainnet, token swap, and node election are expected to be launched in mid-late January.\\n2.

From the trendy iBook to today’s MacBook, Apple’s devices lookstunning. However, if you’ve owned an iPhone, you’ll know that battery life is one of the iPhone’s most limiting factors. My personal iPhone 6s lasts barely 4 hours with my usage. Like manyonline, I’ve always wondered:\\nIt sounds perfect on paper: a phone with great thermals, unending battery life, and performance to boot — and all you have to trade is a little heft. But are you really willing to take that deal?\\nWhen Apple debuted the ultra-thin MacBook in 2015, it was a controversial device. The knee-jerk reaction of the community was to incessantly question it. Was one port too few? Was the keyboard too thin for its own good? Would people pay the premium for it? The answer to all those questions turned out to be yes, but in person, the main reaction was tolook at it.\\nIf you thought that was a one-off, take a look at whatpeople were sayingabout the new 5.9mm thick iPad Pros.\\nApple knows all too well the reaction of its customers when they see their products — first impressions count. People that fall in love with a product at first sight will most likely buy it, so Apple wants to create a positive first impression.',\n",

Untuk post pertama ini saya menggunakan Bahasa Indonesia agar lebih memudahkan saja, pastinya juga karena saya sadar bahasa Inggris saya buruk XD.\\nMengenai topicnya sendiri, mengapaMQ(Messaging Queue)? Saya memilih topic ini karena ini adalah salah satu konsep yang palingchallenginguntuk saya pahami saat join Tokopedia pertama kalinya, dan sangat menarik untuk dipelajari terutama untuk teman-teman yang baru masuk ke dunia web engineering.\\nSederhananya MQ adalah suatu bentuk komunikasi antarservicesecaraasynchronous.Dimana konsep ini banyak digunakan dalam dunia web yang menggunakanmicroservice architecture.Biasanya konsep ini digunakan untuk memisahkan banyak proses yang berat,batch processing, dan untuk segala sesuatu yangtidak harus diselesaikansecarasynchronous.\\nAda 3 komponen utama dalam sebuah konsep MQ. YaituProducer,Queue Platform, danConsumer.\\nSama seperti artinya,Queueberartiantriandalam Bahasa Indonesia.Queue Platformsangat berperan dalam mewujudkan antrian data dariProducerkeConsumer.Data yang diberikan oleh produser tidak akan didistribusikan langsung keconsumernya, melainkan akan dibuatkan sebuah antrian dimanaconsumerakan memproses data satu per satu sesuai dengan antrian yang ada.',\n",

       "  'article': '前面介紹完志工申請的步驟，下篇將接續我在會場中遇到的參展攤位，以及當地的一周行程安排，其中還包含芬蘭獨立日與新創團隊工作環境的參訪。最後還有工作人員專屬的派對分享，如果還沒瀏覽上篇的讀者可以點擊下方連結。北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹上篇。\\n今年主場館有三大舞台，創辦人舞台(Founder Stage)，粉紅舞台(Pink Stage)，恆綠舞台(Evergreen Stage)，每個場地的演講節目表都十分緊湊，每場長度約二十分鐘，加入主持人的串場一天可以安排將近二十場講座，講者涵蓋了潛力獨角獸企業的創辦人、科技評論網站編輯、風險投資公司顧問、歐盟委員會官員、赫爾辛基市長、資訊科技教育家與加密貨幣發行人等，議題的設定也包括了農業科技、大數據分析、機器學習、擴增實境、區塊鍊、加密貨幣、資訊安全、教育創新、電子支付、物聯網、時尚流行產業與運輸物流業等，我一天基本上只聽兩三場，留下深刻印象的兩場，分別是無人機顛覆運輸產業(Launch: Transforming Delivery)，主講人是無人機貨物運輸服務公司Wing的執行長James Ryan Burgess；以及輿論戰場與媒體現況(Info war and peace: The current state of media)，採用訪談形式，主持人是富比世雜誌(Forbes)的歐洲編輯Alex Wood，接受訪問的是科技新聞網站TechCrunch的前共同總編輯Alexia Bonatsos。前者是從Google X專案中畢業的新創企業，在會議中也宣布明年春季開始在芬蘭試營運的計畫，並驕傲地表示會議前一周在寒冷環境下的成功試飛，給了工程團隊很大的信心，在歐洲後續的服務國家也能克服溫度所造成的續航力限制。然而二十分鐘過去，編號7000的原型機，還是只靜靜置於講桌，沒有實際起飛與展示包裹以繩索垂降的遞送方式，只用一分鐘的形象影片作說明，是讓在場眾多航空迷一個小小失望的原因。後者是討論媒體識讀(Media literacy)以及如何提升報導品質的論壇，由於紙媒與網路媒體對於閱聽人的生活影響力比例逐年改變，未經查證的資訊或是帶有偏見的評論變得更容易散播，而對民主與社會造成的傷害也是不分國界的，我想台灣能從國際間借鏡打擊假新聞的策略，來讓四年後的公投能反映出更加成熟的民主素養。\\n對於琳瑯滿目的講座選擇，大家不需要給自己太大的壓力把自由時段排入過多的節目，因為我並不建議將會場的時間都坐在座位上聽演講，一來是所以的演講影片都會在幾周內上傳影音平台YouTube的SLUSH官方頻道，二來是這些大型的演講大多不提供問答時間，除了少部分主持人接受觀眾互動軟體Slido的幾個問題，如果真的對於幾場演講有高度興趣，可以查看工作室訪談(Studio)節目表，兩個大舞台有想對應的如創辦人工作室(Founder Studio)與粉紅工作室(Pink Studio)，另一個同樣精彩的是展場工作室(Showcase Studio)。如果講者有前往工作室接受提問的行程，建議安排好換場步行時間，因為工作室的場地都是只能容納幾十人的小空間，比起上百人湧入的大舞台，需要更多捷足先登的策略。\\n除了這些固定節目外，場地其他部分如同我們在南港展覽館看到的攤位，只是換成深色的背景，搭配無所不在的霓虹燈配色燈光與雷射，再加上很多佈景主題甚至搭建起二樓的商務洽談專屬空間，讓投資者與創業者擁有更多的隱私。現場很多新創公司或是巨型跨國公司都展示虛擬實境(Virtual Reality)的服務，我在兩天親身體驗了三種不同的應用，第一個是名為Glue的芬蘭新創，可以連接地球兩端的團隊成員，在虛擬的會議室開會聽簡報，產品建模也能依照比例呈現，並且自由的在空間中翻轉；第二個是以柏林為基地的新創公司Athena，致力於原型車體內部設計，如座椅的擺設，而車窗以外的景色也隨著時間從郊區駛入市中心的高樓大廈環境，視覺化完整的乘車體驗。\\n最後一個是來自瑞典的機器人與自動化跨國企業ABB(Asea Brown Boveri)，直接引入電動方程式(Formula E)的競速遊戲，坐上可調式的低底盤賽車駕駛座，戴上虛擬實境眼鏡後手握方向盤開始比賽，由於過彎時的方向盤轉向反饋很強烈，視角畫面的流暢度很極高，我非常推薦大家在其他展覽也能親自體驗他們的遊戲。此外會場還有很多我這次來不及嘗試的服務應用，如芬蘭航空(Finnair)讓使用者潛入機場停機坪或是維修棚，模擬操作連結空橋的任務以及更換起降輪零件的工作，與醫療器材製造商廠嬌生公司(Johnson & Johnson)也導入醫院的手術模擬訓練，讓訪客可以依造指示進行膝關節手術。',\n",

       "  'article': 'Putting personal biases to the side, Apple is objectively one of the most important tech companies in existence today. Or at the very least, certainly the most influential.\\nIf you doubt that fact, consider this: Shortly after its release, the iPhone was almost unanimously viewed as the gold standard for smartphones. As a result, many other companies looked to Apple for hints at what consumer and mobile technology could and would become. And by mimicking Apple’s products in the hope of competing, those companies ultimately reinforced Apple’s vision for the future.\\nIn short, we’re living in a world where many of the products we use today, whether they have an Apple logo or not, were made in Apple’s image.\\nBut 2018 hasn’t been the best year for Apple, especially where the iPhone is concerned. After several generations of the same form factor and tired design, Apple unveiled the iPhone X as the next evolution of the iPhone. One of the most polarizing characteristics is the removal of the home button. To compensate, iOS gained a new gesture-based UI in an effort to bring us closer to the dream of an all-screen slab than we’d ever been.\\nThough the new gesture controls and form factor made it somewhat polarizing at first, many reviews praised the iPhone X, calling it “the smartphone of the future.” In fact, there was so much excitement regarding what the iPhone X said about the future of the smartphone that at the start of 2018, the hype was only just starting to dissipate.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Internet of Things (IoT) is a well known buzzword, many people might have heard about for a couple of decades. At same time it can be difficult to understanding what IoT actually covers and how far it is from our mass reality. IoT covers a paradigm of technologies, platforms, and industry solutions. The basic definition of IoT is connecting any- “thing” to each other and/or the Internet. This will potentially affect any object in our lives, since everything that makes sense to connect will be connected. From our leisure time to our professional setting, anything from cars, jet engines and door locks to your shoes will consist of input/output. It is already a reality.\\nEVERYTHING THAT MAKES SENSE TO CONNECT WILL BE CONNECTED.\\nIndustry experts give competing estimates on the number of IoT devices in the future, from 20 to more than 150 billion devices in 2020. As with all other technology, the key interaction will be human, since IoT objects will not only be connected to things, but to people. Whether we use big data and artificial intelligence to make better decisions, remotely control a robot, perform heart surgery in a refugee camp, or customise our physical environment through mixed reality. While broadband Internet has become more widely available, smartphone penetration is sky-rocketing. The worldwide smartphone market will reach a total of\\n1.5 billion units shipped in 2016, up 5.7% from the 1.4 billion units shipped in 2015. From there, shipments will reach 1.92 billion units in 2020. And the cost of connecting people and objects is constantly decreasing, enabling the perfect storm for Internet in Things.\\nINTERNET OF THINGS WILL NOT ONLY CHANGE HOW TECHNOLOGY AFFECTS HUMANS, BUT ENFORCE A CHANGE IN MOST POWER STRUCTURES AS WE KNOW THEM, FROM DEMOCRACY TO AUTHORITY.',\n",

       "  'article': 'I am hesitant to talk about “innovation” or any kind of so-called “elevation” of the term (as the theme insists, as the theme presupposes, as the themevehemently desires) because the word is, in my osmotic understanding of the popular imagination, aggressively optimistic and naively utopic to a fault in daily use. Before, when I was still in advertising, the rallying call was always to innovate (products, mediums, taglines, points-of-purchase, packaging designs, greeting cards, literally everything we had to work on) because it is supposedly the only manner by which businesses can stay afloat and through which advertising can ‘somehow’ disseminate the never-before articulated insights of national consciousness across a whole host of massive media outlets and endless commercial seasons. Simply put, everyone is being charged with the responsibility to innovate, ceaselessly and relentlessly, across all disciplines and all positions, and part of my reluctance regarding this whole endeavor of talking about it stems from the fact that for the past few years, I and the people I work with have done nothing but talk about and be governed by the concept of innovation, to the point that not only has it become nonsensical, in the way that any word gets when it is repeated incessantly, automatically, and fervently, but also tortuous in its endlessness.\\nAs a Philippine radio station ID constantly belts out, in monotonous succession: “What is the meaning of this?”¹ One can start answering that question etymologically.\\nInnovation as a word emerged in the mid-sixteenth century, from the Latininnovat- ‘renewed, altered’ from the verbinnovare, fromin- ‘into’ +novare‘make new’ (fromnovus‘new’).² Interestingly, it was first used as a kind of invective, one hurled at heretical troublemakers who refused to follow the religious doctrine held sacred by sixteenth to seventeenth century Puritans.³ The logic seems to be that one could never hope to be a good person if one was always trying to break biblical rules, and that carried a lot of weight in a European setting where people were, contextually, undergoing massive upheavals both in their religious and political structures.\\nIt was a combination of the scientific turn, the Industrial Revolution, and the rise of capitalism which redeemed “innovation” from the bottom of the metaphorical trash heap moralism had buried it in and polished it with a veneer of progressiveness. Specifically, Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter “definedinventionas an act of intellectual creativity undertaken without any thought given to its possible economic import, whileinnovationhappens when firms figure out how to craft inventions into constructive changes in their business model.”⁴ From here, economics becomes the key feature which differentiates the term from creative invention, and up until now, we still operate under the same assumption. Innovation is pointless if it does not generate some kind of profit, because then it would be similar to art, which, while uplifting, is not financially remunerative. Or, if you would like to state it in another way, you’ll find it difficult to come across anyone willing to pay you for your art, but you’ll always find someone willing to pay you if you promise them innovation.\\nFast forward to 1991, wherein Fredric Jameson described innovation as not only characteristic of the postmodern condition, but also as one of the beliefs that alienates us from the history of the world. “The frantic economic urgency of producing fresh waves of ever more novel-seeming goods (from clothing to airplanes), at ever greater rates of turnover, now assigns an increasingly essential structural function and position to aesthetic innovation and experimentation . . . We now inhabit the synchronic rather than the diachronic, and I think it is at least empirically arguable that our daily life, our psychic experience, our cultural languages, are today dominated by categories of space rather than by categories of time . . .”⁵ In other words, there really is nothing new about the new, or the way we think about the new. In fact, we have become so used to the concept that we live in a state where it is constantly commodified to the point that is an expectation of the everyday. Jameson’s propositions mirror the mood illustrated by Walter Benjamin’s writing onAngelus Novus, which is quoted in the very beginning of this essay. While there are some dissimilarities with regard to how they envision the shape and function of history — from Benjamin’s single catastrophe to Jameson’s ironic alternatives — both nevertheless believe that innovation without history can only produce a future more bereft, more intolerable, and more alienated to real human conditions, than the present that births it.',\n",

       "  'article': 'LinkedIn approached me about expressing my views on what will be the Big Ideas of 2019, in a similar vein to theirprediction piece. So I came up with my own list, except these are not predictions per se — after all, I’m no shaman and I can’t see the future. Instead, the ideas on this list — they are simply in the air and I’m only channeling them. Some of these ideas will materialize in 2019, whereas other ones are clearly long-term and they will play out over the course of years if not decades.\\nWith de-globalization picking up steam, deeper economies of scale are becoming increasingly unsustainable. This presents companies with a challenge and an opportunity at the same time. The challenge is that they have to bring additional portions of manufacturing chain in-house. On the other hand, it gives companies the opportunity to ensure excellent end-to-end user experience with their products. Of recent examples, Tesla has been masterful in using vertical integration to its advantage. But the big-picture benefit here is growing re-industrialization and diversity of domestic manufacturing capabilities, which will have very positive long-term effect on many aspects of life: from improved standard of living for the population as a whole, to strengthened geopolitical position of the country.\\nIn another consequence of fragmenting global markets, the pace of innovation is slowing down, especially in the R&D-intensive areas. Just see how much difficulty Intel is having with their 10nm products. Another example is advanced display technologies. Currently the buzz is hot around flexible displays: folding phones and roll-up TV screens. While technical feasibility of such products exists, their high prices will not likely be conducive to wide-spread market success, especially in the climate of decreasing consumer purchasing power, tied to projected economic downturn of 2019. I mean, how many flat-screen TVs does a reasonable person need in every room, including bathrooms? That’s not to say that advanced research should not be done, however it would have to be re-angled from near-term commercial profitability to more strategic goals.\\nAs the ancient wisdom says, nobody can enter the same river twice. By the same token, it’s not possible to carry out re-industrialization using last century technologies. In order for the economy to regain its industrial strength in the competitive landscape, we need a lot of breakthroughs in all areas of science. Unfortunately, core scientific fields are not as popular with American college students nowadays, compared to Business degrees for example. In fact, hard majors like Physics don’t even register in top-40 rankings, according tosome studies. While the focus on STEM is gaining momentum, we still have ways to go before this society starts producing required amounts of scientific brainpower. How glorious will be the day when a PhD in Materials Science, for example, becomes more desirable than an MBA!\\nIt is high time for this country to set aside its disagreements and work together towards common goals. Some of these goals may be technological in nature, for example: spreading human civilization beyond planet Earth; while others may be focused on social progress, for example: eradicating poverty and hunger. Naturally, technology will be heavily involved in anything we do in this day and age, but that’s not the main point. Advanced modern technologies would allow this society to set such ambitious and worthy goals that the overwhelming majority of the population can get behind in full consciousness — this is the uniting factor. And these goals will actually be demonstrably achievable through the course of scientific progress, which will reinforce confidence in the initiatives. Could this be the foundation of the New American Dream? Because the old promise — that children live better than parents — does not hold true anymore. Just ask the millennials.',\n",

       "  'article': '** Note: As apart of KPCB’s Product Fellows Program application, I have been asked to describe “the last product you used that took [my] breath away.” **\\nIn recent years, Instagram has grown considerably from an app that shares photos amongst friends into a social network where users can interact with friends and many different forms of media. A significant change that has happened recently is the introduction of Instagram TV (IGTV). IGTV was created as a long-form (less than an hour) video hub for videos longer than the 1- minute videos you may encounter in you normal instagram feed. It is also distinguished differently from the 10 second videos located in Instagram stories. IGTV is accessible from a button inside the Instagram home screen, as well as a standalone app, IGTV will spotlight popular videos from Instagram celebrities and creators.\\nIGTV enables anyone to be a creator, not just big-name celebrities. People can upload vertical videos through Instagram’s app or the web. Everyone except smaller and new accounts can upload hour-long videos immediately. The IGTV app is available globally oniOSandAndroid, as well as in the Instagram app through a TV shaped button above Stories. Viewers are able to swipe through a variety of longer-form videos, or swipe up to visit a browse tab of personally recommended videos, popular videos, creators they’re following and the option to continue watching previously started videos. Users also get callouts from the IGTV button alerting them to new content.\\nIGTV lets creators develop Instagram Channels full of their different videos that people can subscribe to. Creators are also able to put links in the description of their videos to drive traffic to their other social presences, e-commerce stores or websites. Below is an 1 minute demo of IGTV.\\nInstagram has created an opportunity to settle into a sweet spot between YouTube and Snapchat Discover. YouTube offers an incredible breadth of content, but it’s so packed with amateurish videos that it can be tough to find the gems. With algorithmic, personalized curation and a narrower set of sources, Instagram could raise the likelihood that users will like what they’re shown. That could encourage users to fill a 7- 10 minute Uber ride or 30-minute commute with Instagram’s long-form video platform rather than aimlessly wandering the web.',\n",

Now, you have a choice!\\nAn international award winning start-up, Simplify, has launched a mobile app to let you sell your unutilized monthly mobile data bandwidth for cash. In its mission to make Internet more affordable and accessible, Simplify aims to rechannel unused Internet bandwidth for the needy. Remember, there are still 4 Billion people on the planet without Internet access.\\nThe company first launched its service in late 2016 and since be crowned two major accolades which includes being named as one of the Most Innovative Companies and Most Disruptive Business on the planet. Its notable use cases cover Grab drivers selling to passengers as an extra income, tour guides selling to foreign tourists who didn’t purchase a local SIM card or refused to turn on the expensive data roaming.\\nInterestingly, Simplify tends to create a new sharing economy in the mobile broadband space to benefit 3 major segments of mobile users: 1) Unlimited data plan; 2) Mid-tier data plan with huge data quota; 3) Prepaid plan with very limited quota.\\nIf you fall under the first two categories, Simplify has the right solution for you to sell off your unused data bandwidth to subsidize your own mobile data plan! This app has created a win-win solution to the consumers: You sell your unused mobile data for cash, and buyers get to buy your data on a pay-as-you-go basis. Sellers can fix the rate they wish to sell, for example RM8/GB. Like Grab and AirBnB, Simplify will take 20% commission out of the total data revenue sold (p/s: the company needs it to maintain their server).',\n",

The degree to which social media has been in play in our elections is mind-boggling, and only now seems to have become apparent.\\nIt’s not like the 2016 election was the first to utilize social media influence. Obama was adept to a certain degree with the emerging possibilities of social media, asthis Atlantic article notes.

Was it to promote the use of Microsoft’s IDE, Visual Studio Code? Nope, as CEO Satya Nadella has assured us that there will be no major changes to GitHub’s infrastructure. Though no clear statement was made on GitHub’s use to Microsoft, it is clear that Microsoft is shifting its company ideologies in a new direction, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and open source. Instead, with GitHub’s 27 million+ software developers working on over 85 million repositories of code, it is quite apparent that Microsoft is focusing on serving software developers (whether those developers are coding for Windows or not).\\nGitHub assures its users that this acquisition would have no impact on the platform they’ve come to love. Current CEO Chris Wanstrath said that “Their focus on developers lines up perfectly with our own, and their scale, tools and global cloud will play a huge role in making GitHub even more valuable for developers everywhere.” With Nat Friedman taking over GitHub as CEO and Wanstrath gearing up to join Microsoft’s board, Wanstrath’s faith in Microsoft is largely based on their ability to maintain a high level of autonomy and on the moves made by Microsoft’s current CEO over the past few years. In fact, let’s talk a little bit about the level-headed and forward-thinking vanguard of Microsoft: Satya Nadella.\\nThis deal shows the enormous changes that the current CEO has put in place since he took charge. Only a couple of years ago, Microsoft was taking yearly losses as it struggled to compete with the giants of Google and Apple. By ditching the Windows Phone, Microsoft has been able to focus on improving different aspects of its business model. With its emphasis on computing, Microsoft has taken leaps which show in their increased profits and (finally) some significant positive quarterly earnings. Nadella’s move to acquire LinkedIn in 2016 was no rushed decision either. A 26 billion dollar acquisition, Satya Nadella was turning the company around from Steve Ballmer’s costly mistake with Nokia, where Microsoft tried to capture the mobile market by pushing the Windows Phone. Nadella is committed to shaping the image of Microsoft from one of a closed community to one of open inclusion. His accomplishment with shifting Microsoft’s public image cannot be understated and, with his latest move, it seems that Nadella is making all of the right moves, opening his arms to open source software.',\n",

In 2018, cryptocurrency markets continued to show growth in regions across the globe, showcasing the world’s desire to exercise more control over their finances.\\nSince before the boom of December 2017, the crypto industry broke into the watchful, and sometimes cynical eye of the public.

       "  'article': 'When mobiles appeared on the market, it was a terrible alternative to the then present solution, which was a personal computer. No one could imagine using Word and Excel, let alone AR & VR, on a brick-sized object which didn’t make you even look slick. But features such as GPRS, instant messaging and, most remarkably, intangible aspect “mobility”, revolutionised the industry and now we can’t think of a world without our devices.\\nSuch is the case with blockchain, and it’s not a great working alternative to the present solution. It’s hard to understand, difficult to code, difficult to implement and has a low adoption. But the intangible aspect that blockchain brings to the table is “trust” that is not centralised under a single authority. Now we can create money, documents, bills and many more things from anywhere for everywhere. But, it is going to take a few years before blockchain becomes a household concept.\\nHow is blockchain going to become a household concept? A 5-year-old doesn’t care about the inner workings of a mobile nor of blockchain. They only want to play angry birds. Similarly, a working professional doesn’t care much about the inner workings of a food and grocery delivery app, they are concerned about food being delivered at their doorstep.\\nMass adoption comes from distribution that does not disrupt the daily working of a consumer. To build distribution you need various catalysts at different stages. Bitcoin was for the early blockchain adopters, nerds who wanted to explain to 5 yr olds what blockchain is. Now comes the turn of the early and late majority for mass adoption. We need to wait and watch to see what will catalyse mass majority.\\nSectors and projects that will move the needle in the blockchain space in 2019 will be the financial, insurance and retail industry and projects such asFilecoin,Protocol Labs,Origin, andPROPShave the possibility to become mainstream options to the present alternatives.',\n",

I disagree, with this highly, if we look this problem from all angles and help navigate our children through responsible use of mobile technology. After all, how can we say chidlren aren’t old enough, even when adults have bad phone habits themselves. (Myself included.)\\nWorking from home and learning from home (that’s what I call homeschool), my kids throughout the day may find me texting mom, checking email, making a post, sharing a story on instagram, researching, and so on. They see me use my phone for so many things, they don’t see how much has changed in a decade since these devices have taken over uni-tasking technology.\\nIt’s not their fault, look around anywhere in a modernized environment and observe how many adults have their heads hunched down flipping their thumbs up and down on the over the tiny smooth screen. If I was a kid in this era I’d be absorbed too, pondering what do adults do with these things.\\nActually, tablets and such are nothing new to my kids. They’ve been exposed to an iPad and old iPod touch that weren’t being used since I’ve been able to get a iPhone 4s. During that time my kids were interested in playing games and now they’ve become curious about how to make videos, taking pictures with legos, and how to make apps.\\nLast year, we sold the iPad, the iPod touch was long gone, and were just left with our phones. The kids were okay with this as they trying to save money for a Minecraft Edition Xbox One. I allowed them to borrow my phone to use so they could watch Minecraft tutorials, videos for schoolwork, crafts and reviews for toys. Not long after they wanted to learn to make their own videos just like these.',\n",

       "  'article': 'The purpose of a librarian is to help the reader navigate overwhelm. The library is a huge place, that collects information that is organized by a set of rules. The librarian, familiar with the rules, listens to the reader and guides them to the appropriate section, author, or title. On the internet, we are faced with one of the largest libraries in the world. Similar to the moving staircases in Harry Potter, the rules change, the platforms change, and it can be difficult to find real news, useful information, or good content. Because the internet is vast and hard to navigate, I find we need guides, similar to librarians, who can take us to the places that contain the information that we need.\\nThe first librarian is our search engine (most likely Google). However Google is influenced by paid advertisements, and our results can be determined by what people want to sell us rather than what we actually want to read. This is why I have come back to a more humanistic approach to getting recommendations, since people tend to curate every day and can guide us (like librarians) to the real and true information. The second librarian, then, is our community.\\nEvery day I am on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, scrolling through a sea of content, liking, following, and unfollowing as I see fit. This is a form of curation that allows me to tailor my feed to my tastes. You do this, your friends to this, and anyone online does a version of this, making us all curators. We weed out what we don’t want to see and maximize what we do want. The result is a unique assortment of content that falls in line with what we want. Each person has specific taste, which makes each collection of online content singular and special.\\nFor example, I have a friend named Oscar who subscribes to an assortment of meme pages on Facebook, which he then shares through his own Facebook page. He shares the ones that he likes, and thus establishes a tone through his shared content. I enjoy the memes that Oscar shares, and even though he is not producing original content, the stream itself feels like original content. It is a little like making a music mashup. The final result is a piece of art build from the art of others. It reminds me of collages, or a scrapbook collection.\\nOscar’s product is his taste, which I support and subscribe to. In an effort to understand other people’s tastes and tendencies towards curation, I started a project called “CultureBucket”, in which I ask my friends every year to make a “Best of” list of media they consumed. This way I get a sense of what my friends are interested and the themes they follow in their own curation. I post these lists on a blog which you can readhere.',\n",

In this blog post, I will go through the set up of my project. In the next one, I am planning to show how to set up testing. I would also like to add a server to this using Node.js, but not sure if the scope of my project would need that.\\n(Note: I have provided my Webpack setup at the end of this blog post)\\nWithout further ado, let’s get on with the set up!\\nMake anew projectandcdinto it:',\n",

       "  'article': 'With the coming of a new year comes new goals, new dreams — and most importantly, new technology. When technology has existed for a while we forget how sometimes there is a security risk involved in using it. This can be said about the file directory navigation system.\\nSince the first computer system came out the hierarchical file structure could be navigated through the command line system. After operating systems improved and GUI (graphical user interfaces) systems evolved the computer’s internal file structure could be traversed through a GUI interface. Of course, with every new advancement comes new exploitation. Cyber criminals that gain access to your hardware can download sensitive documents with 2 to 3 clicks of a mouse. As a precautionary measure you could put a password on your work folder and make it more difficult to obtain your documents — but once that password is cracked, then it’s all for naught.\\nTo resolve this problem IBM has crafted an innovative piece of technology called the Decoy File system (DcyFS). Like layering a cake, the DcyFS overlays a custom view that can do each of the following:\\nThe DcyFS system provides write control on documents you designate as “sensitive.” With documents given the “sensitive” tag, the DcyFS system replaces those files with fakes. In addition it can also create a honeypot trap by adding fake documents to entice cyber criminals looking to steal information. Once the “honey pot” is accessed it will leave a forensic trail for specialists to analyze and identify the users main objective. Check out the full 3 part article in the source link below for more details. We at zCode solutions support coding for the sake of problem solving.

       "  'article': 'When you see the words ‘fake news’, you probably start to think of click-bait popping up on your social media feed, or some story in the papers the other day which got discredited the day after, or President Trump’s face swims before your eyes. You can practically hear him saying it. ‘Fake news’.\\nI’m here to tell you, that you, are (probably) fake news.\\nIf you have a social media account, the chances are you are at least vaguely aware of your online image, you know what you have uploaded to your profile(s) and you don’t put any old toot up there. Why? It’s because, whether you admit it or not, you want to look good in the eyes of others. From the profile picture you set, to the daily, weekly or monthly posts you make (depending on how much of a lurker you are) you are making decisions about how you want people to perceive you; a physical image and a personality image. A cherry-picked impression of the real life you. You, but through rose coloured spectacles.\\nI’m not going to tell you this is a terrible thing that you shouldn’t do. After all, you should be careful what you put online these days, especially with nosy potential employers turning to social media to get a behind-the-curtain look at prospectus employees and their habits. However, when you start to see other people’s online profiles, it can be easy to forget that they do the exact same thing. In fact, according to the 2018 ‘Vacation Confidence Index’¹ 36% of people aged 18–34 admitted they deceive their social media followers with their posts, making their holidays seem greater than they were. The main reasons for doing this were to either make their followers envious, or to try and one up the other accounts they followed on social media.\\nThis can end up giving the rather depressing impression that your life only has great bits in a sea of mediocrity, but everybody else is always having an absolutely great time. All the time. It unsurprising then, that social media users tend to have be more depressed¹. It’s important to maintain perspective when using social media, as the saying goes, ‘the grass is always greener on the other side’. Well now the other side is covered in flowers, puppies are everywhere and the old worn-down shed is covered by Potter’s cloak of invisibility. It’s hard not to be dissatisfied with your own patchy grass when faced with that.',\n",

La ciberseguridad volverá a ser uno de los principales focos de atención tanto para las empresas como para los usuarios particulares, habida cuenta de las crecientes amenazan que pululan por la red. El informe de PandaLabs para 2019 se atreve a aventurar cuáles serán las tendencias en ciberseguridad más importantes.\\nAl igual que elstreamingha cambiado la forma en la que escuchamos música, sin necesidad ya de adquirir discos o de descargar previamente las pistas, la piratería también podría optar por un formato “en vivo”. Esta es una tendencia delictiva particularmente grave porque nunca se sabe cuándo y dónde se va a producir el siguiente ataque. No hay unmalwarea la espera de ser descargado imprudentemente sino que unhackerataca directamente una red.\\nQuédate con este concepto porque es posible que no tardes mucho en escucharlo por boca de alguna de las principales autoridades de la Unión Europea. Esta organización supranacional está dotándose de mayores recursos para hacer frente al desafío de la ciberseguridad y la soberanía digital puede ser una realidad legislativa a medio plazo. Proteger el espacio digital de la UE es una prioridad desde que se constatara la injerencia de potencias extranjeras en procesos electorales de algunos países miembros.\\nJunto a los dos novedades anteriores, algunas de las amenazas que ya afectaron a la ciberseguridad mundial en 2018 seguirán estando presentes -y con mayor intensidad- en 2019.\\nEl uso indebido de computadoras para hacer trabajos de minería de criptomonedas parece un riesgo menor pero lo cierto es que se traduce en un consumo de datos muy oneroso, al tiempo que colaboramos indirectamente con un comportamiento delictivo.',\n",

Its properties are truly unique, which is why it is so often used to clean a variety of surfaces. From this material, you will learn about the history of creation, composition, characteristics, and applications of microfiber.\\nMicrofiber was developed in 1976 in Japan, but its widespread production became possible (and economically viable) only after several years. However, immediately after the invention of this unusual material in allmaid servicerespects, the world appreciated the revolutionary discovery and the opportunities that had opened up.\\nThecleaning servicesmaterial consists of only two substances — polyester (forming fiber) and nylon (forming the core) in a ratio of 4/1. The resulting tissue has millions of microscopic triangular pores. They quickly absorb water (ten times faster than any other material) and absorb dust using contact electrification. The liquid then evaporates quickly, and the dirt lingers in the pores of the microfiber cloth.\\nThe reason why microfiber retains dust so well is the improperly branched structure of microscopic triangular pores. This is what allows it to surpass its counterparts so much — gauze, paper, and various special cleaning materials.',\n",

A helpful ad on Google will match a searcher’s keywords with a relevant landing page, but redirect ads provide counter-messaging and often alternative destinations that go against the search words.\\nFor example, if you search Google for “iPhone 6S,” you’re predictably going to be shown an ad for the iPhone 6S. By clicking that ad, you’ll probably land on a page where you can buy one. A redirect ad, however, might twist your search and prompt you with something like this for a Galaxy S6 instead:\\nIn this example, Samsung is trying to swerve the searcher’s intent with counter-messaging and is betting the searcher will question their brand loyalty, click the ad, and convert from Apple to Samsung.\\nIt’s one thing to (fairly obviously) redirect an ad in a smartphone search.

I like to ask the question, “what about our work and lives today will feel ridiculous ten plus years from now?” What about the future will feel obvious in retrospect?\\nFuture forecasts are not an investment thesis because innovations, no matter how exciting they are, won’t happen until the present is ready for them (and this is why the best investors are more insightful about the present than they are about the future). But if you’re a product leader, entrepreneur, or very early-stage investor, future thinking tunes your attention and instincts. It also helps you determine whether a team is attempting to defy a likely outcome or make it happen in a better way.\\nThis year I shared some early thoughts on Twitter and solicited other ideas, which I have incorporated and attributed across the 8 themes below. I have also tried to connect some of my work and investments to these themes, which has been an interesting exercise.\\nLet’s jump in.\\nThis is a trend I have been following for sometime andrecently wrote about. As modern interfaces like voice remove options, augmented reality overlays our physical world, and artificial intelligence gains our trust by transcending our own reasoning, defaults will rule our lives and interfaces will compete against one another.

This is fine until you try to start planning around those stories. At that point, you need to be asking: What are the priorities today and how do we execute on those priorities without mortgaging the future? The reverse question is just as important: How much time do we spend working on those new things that aren’t generating revenue yet?\\nEvery startup should have three stories, loosely related to the three arcs most storytellers use in episodic storytelling. An easy way to think about it is a television series. When you watch an episode of a TV show, the writers are usually working on three storylines:\\nStory A: Story with an arc that begins and ends in this episode (or maybe a two-parter).',\n",

This one made its way into the hands ofJean-Luc Aufranc, from theCNX Software blog, over the Christmas vacation.\\nOn the face of it, this is an intriguing addition to Espressif’s product lineup. With most of themajor machine learning toolsbeing heavily optimised for Arm-based architectures, Espressif with its Tensilica-based chips is in danger of being left behind when it comes to machine learning on the edge. One of the reasons I was so excited bySeeed Studio’s Air602 modulereleased late last year is that it’s a price comparable ESP8266 competitor that’s built on Arm.\\nOn the surface, the board itself looks a lot like a neater, more finished version of theprototype Ai-Thinker CAM boardwe saw towards the middle of last year, as well a few of the other ESP32-based camera boards I’ve seen. What’s different here is of course that this is, presumably, going to be an“official”Espressif product and that implies a better level of software support than we’ve seen before. But, at least right now, there doesn’t seem to be any details of the software stack they’re using on the board, although it’s likely to be their ownESP-WHO framework. Which is sort of interesting.\\nIn fact, there really doesn’t seem to be manydetails of the new boardat all; there certainly isn’t any information available on theEspressifwebsite. Beyond the handful of boards that got sent out to the community over the Christmas break, the new board hasn’t made it into more general circulation. It isn’t yet for sale, and there is no word on pricing or even a release date.\\nSo, now all I have to do is figure out how to get my hands on one…?',\n",

And while picking up a new 11-inch iPad Pro definitely qualifies as an impulse purchase, it’s impressive utility as a design tool has more than compensated for some of the post-impulse-purchase guilt.\\nUntil now, I’ve never owned an iPad or ever really had the need or desire to own one. So when I picked up the 2nd generation Apple Pencil and started doodling on one of the new iPads to kill time in the Apple Store, my expectations were pretty flat. It was another super pretty piece of Apple glass with a $120 stylus. Oh, it costs another $200 to add on the ‘smart’ keyboard? Classic Apple play. Fun to mess around with on an Apple Store errand, but not something I’d actually consider shelling out for.\\nI sketched a couple quick figures, some portraits, and other random doodles. Whoa, this thing was pretty sleek. The interaction between the pen and the screen was impressively smooth. The sensitivity of the stylus captured my sketchy/messy drawing style surprisingly well. I’ve always loved drawing with pen and paper, but have never really transferred over to digital mediums because you tend to lose that organic feel and style. Not the case with this magic little slate. Then I tried sketching out a couple basic wireframe shapes. I drew a crooked box that I didn’t like, so I double tapped the pen to bring up the eraser in a seamless and intuitive motion, corrected the mistake, and continued on with the sketches. Uh oh. I was officially delighted.\\nNeedless to say, I went home with the iPad with the insurance of an extended holiday return policy. I had a month and a half (instead of the usual two weeks) to explore and decide if it was worth the hefty price tag. Pack your bags Frodo, this was going to be a journey.\\nFor the next couple of weeks, I explored a huge range of design-oriented apps to put the iPad to the test. Right off the bat, it became clear that some of the most impressive apps (unsurprisingly) belong to the Adobe family.',\n",

But, your controller can definitely hold you back — nobody wants to playDr. Mariowith a computer keyboard, after all. Even if you have a controller with the correct layout, subtle differences in button feel can completely ruin the experience. But if you have a Game Boy,you can now use it as a wireless controller thanks to this special cartridge.\\nThe Wireless Gameboy Controller Device is a cartridge that’s compatible with the original Game Boy, the Game Boy Pocket, the Game Boy Color, the Game Boy Advance, and the Advance SP. It’ll turn your Game Boy of choice into a wireless controller that works with a PC, a Raspberry Pi, or a GameCube. That means you canplay a gamelikePokémon RedorBluethrough RetroPie running ona Raspberry Pi, while using an actual Game Boy Color as the controller!\\nThe cartridge works by making your Game Boy think you’re playing an actual game. There’s nothing on the Game Boy’s screen, but the “game” still accepts all of the button inputs. Every 2ms, it checks for a button press, and sends those button presses to a wireless receiver plugged into your computer or Raspberry Pi. The receiver refreshes every 8ms, so there shouldn’t be any noticeable input lag. Simply put, it’s a streamlined solution for your using your Game Boy as a wireless controller.\\nStock is limited, but you can snag a Wireless Gameboy Controller Device frominsideGadgets’ Tindie storefor $39 plus shipping.

       "  'article': 'The lightning network seems to be the answer to all Bitcoin and blockchain related ills: the ideal alternative to the clogged, clumped, over-crowded payment processing ecosystem we’re currently saddled with, with its slow speed, high transaction fees and all-around, ever pervading inefficiency. Surely, with Bitcoin being the natural evolution of currency (and by extension, humanity itself), improved levels of usability should freely follow in its wake — however, as is often the case within the launch of new technologies, the final infrastructure does tend to lag several steps (or miles) behind. With Visa able to process 24,000 transactions per second, Bitcoin Cash 61 and Bitcoin a mere 7 transactions per second, its inadequacy is glaringly obvious to all members of the crypto community.\\nThe lightning network grew into prominence during the more nascent architectural days of 2017, before its official, full-blooded incarnation in March 2018. Since then, particularly in recent months, it has travelled swiftly from strength to strength. One of the key players — and early adopters — within the lightning network space is Bitfury. Bitfury is “one of the largest full-service blockchain technology companies in the world”, providing both software and hardware solutions for businesses, governments, organizations and individuals to securely transfer assets across the blockchain network. Interestingly, Bitfury have been the first to fully implement a lightning-network based coffee-purchasing system. Their lightning network engineering team, known as LightningPeach, partnered with payments startup Paytomat in order to launch the lightning network via their platform — an all-around successful integration, garnering further faith in the Lightning Network, and pushing Paytomat up the rankings of revolutionary retribution platforms.\\nLightning Labs, the infamous proponents of the Lightning Network, have achieved a significant amount over the past year: regardless of Bitcoin’s dips, its ability to travel sideways, upside down and fling itself askance in every other direction, the lightning network itself has gone from strength to strength, unfazed by market volatility. November saw the network top 4,000 nodes and before burgeoning to uphold over $2 million value of bitcoin, its capacity continuing to rise after the spiral of BTC, experiencing an increase of almost 300%. Yes, it’s still possible to remain profitable during a stark, bleak crypto midwinter. For instance, the number of crypto ATMs around the world kept growing steadily, with 209 machines opening around the world in December.\\nCanadian BTC mining company Hut 8 claimed a record high $13.5 million for Q3 2018, and Japanese IT giant GMO reported that its crypto businesses, including mining equipment production and its crypto exchange, gained 2.6 billion yen ($22.8 million) during the same period (although some fraudulent dabbling may have been involved).\\nOpen Node, a well-seasoned, dynamic member of the lightning network conglomerate, has begun to painstakingly facilitate the launch of the ideal bitcoin payment processing system, negotiating its widespread acceptance with as many merchants as possible, including Starbucks and Tesla, according to Tim Draper’s excited tweet last month. OpenNode charge a transaction fee of 1%: as far as revenue generation goes, it’s hardly outlandish, particularly when stacked beside a successful, all-encompassing payment network.',\n",

       "  'article': 'People obsess about college rankings, baseball stats, and other forms of numerology out of a natural human desire to simplify and bring order to their world. Seed stage startups often do this by fixating on a single revenue number — a million-dollar run rate.\\nAs far as round numbers go, a million dollars of annual revenue is a great sign of progress. Once upon a time, it really was a marker that made a meaningful difference in raising a Series A, but the imaginary milestone of $83K in MRR isn’t the ticket to a Series A that it was five years ago.\\nOver the last half-decade, there’s been substantial inflation in round sizes, to the point where a Series A has the dimensions, and prerequisites, of what would have been closer to a Series B round 5 years ago. When evaluating decks, Series A investors won’t treat companies with $900K and $1.1M in annual revenue differently. Today, the benchmarks to land a series A often include several million dollars of revenue, accelerating at an impressive velocity, and combined with well-rounded leadership teams, and impressive customer rosters. The bar has meaningfully moved from five years ago.\\nStill, many founders fetishize it this one number. They insist it’s what’s keeping VCs from taking them seriously. They’ll increase their burn and spend inappropriately to get to it. And most of the time, this is a waste of focus and resources. The better advice is to grow revenue as quickly as you can, sustainably, and focus most of your attention on helping investors answer one critical question.\\nVenture capital is a velocity business and every good VC’s portfolio is going to have a few companies that have taken off like a rocket ship. Investors want to know why you’ll be like that company, and not one of a dozen slow-growing zombie startups from whose boards they can’t escape.',\n",

On the other hand, there is something satisfying about owning an album, and physically grabbing it from a stack of media, an experience that is lost in this virtual shuffle.\\nDesigner Chris Pattyhas some up with a solution to this dilemma — a music player housed in a nicely finished block of wood that uses cards to select the song. Users pick a card with the single to be played out of one of two rectangular card holders, then swipe it through a mag-stripe reader slot. This type of card was chosen over the NFC variety to save costs, though according to Patty, it’s actually quite satisfying to swipe cards like this. Cleverly, the art on the cards is pulled from Spotify with a custom user interface, then printed as stick-on labels.\\nUnder the nicely carved wooden “hood,” the system features a speaker powered by aRaspberry Pi, with songs stored locally. Patty discusses thejukebox on Twitter, including a short clip of it in action. He even reveals that he’s planning to make it open source, and will do a Kickstarter for the device for those that are less DIY-inclined.\\n[h/t:The Verge]',\n",

For the early decades of chip development, Moore’s “law” was actually observed more in its contravention than in its adherence. Chips were becoming faster and smaller at a rate far in excess of Moore’s observations.

       "  'article': 'When I landed in Berlin in the early hours of 2015, I had no idea what was in store for me. Almost four years later, I look back on a journey of massive personal development, thanks to the rollercoaster that is working at a hyper-growth technology startup. Throughout my time at HelloFresh, change was the only constant; my role kept morphing every few months, even if the job title sometimes didn’t. The company quickly went from startup to scale-up and being an early employee on the tech team — eventually moving up to a Director of Engineering role — gave me the opportunity to amass a lot of experience in many areas: technical leadership, hiring and firing, performance management, organisational design… the list goes on.\\nBut eventually, the time came when I felt my personal growth was no longer aligned with the company’s growth and I knew I had to move on. Being ambitious — and sometimes a little too eager — I wanted to leverage all the learnings by taking a shot at leading an engineering organisation within a smaller startup looking to scale up. I yearned to be given the trust to build a world-class engineering team. With this in mind, I started opening my ears to all the executive recruiting approaches I was getting, engaging with those I found interesting. That’s how TourRadar soon popped up on my radar and, once I went through the whole interviewing process, I had a decision to make. It has now been 3 months since I joined the company as their first VP of Engineering.\\nSo why did I joinTourRadar?\\nThe first thing that got me excited about TourRadar was that it seemed to be solving a problem that had not yet been truly solved — bringing multi-day touring online, a business that for the longest time was done through brick and mortar travel agencies. I quickly realised the challenges in selling this type of product online had to be very significant: a marketplace model, with high basket sizes and multiple touch points on and off-site. No wonder it was being touted as the “last frontier” of online travel.\\nThe fact that travelling, especially for longer periods of time, can be transformative, coupled with the technical and business challenges I could perceive, made the company’s vision of “connecting people to life-enriching travel experiences” one I felt compelled to work for. And from a business perspective, it became obvious that solving this challenge at scale, with no real incumbent in sight, could mean massive upside in a global, multi-billion dollar industry.',\n",

Game Jams!\\nIt is a contest where you get a theme in start and a deadline before which you need to finish and submit the game. It is like a hackathon but for game developers.\\nThere are always 10+ game jams running simultaneously onItch.io. So you can easily find one that fits your schedule. If you are very busy you can pick a weekend one like I did.\\nOne amazing thing about these game jams is that there are always Discord channels or Forums associated with each. Here you can post the type of work you want to do and you can team up with others that are finding you.\\nIt can be scary most of the times to ask out someone. But has it ever been easy? Think it this way, you are here to learn. You want to enter this contest so at end of it you know a thing or two more about game development than your current self. These jams are popular enough that you will surely find another newbie teammate.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Looking back, I have no idea how I passed my first interview. I remember I did alright but definitely failed one or two portions of it. I also did it completely over Skype which made the whole process way more painful. Definitely not a performance I can look back on and be proud of but it did land me my first internship.\\nBack then, I had no idea what companies were looking for. I thought that finishing most of a problem would be enough. Or showing that I somewhat understood what the solution might be might get me through. I thought that was all I needed for a company to give me a chance. I was naive. Companies are taking a huge risk whenever they hire a new employee. You need to make sure that the company you are interviewing for will be excited to have you onboard. If you’ve achieved that, then you’ve nailed the interview.\\nFirst things first, highlight your strengths. What makes you a strong candidate? What will set you apart? I knew my background in teaching gave me a unique perspective and skill set. Regularly presenting in front of a lot of people allowed me to bring something extra to the table. And I’d much rather speak in front of an unimpressed software engineer over a group of pissed off teenagers any day. I made sure to take advantage of this skill during the interview. It especially became useful when chatting with the CEO of the small company I was interviewing for.\\nI also had gone above and beyond on a website project I did for my degree program. The requirement was to have a basic HTML page with some JavaScript backing it. I decided to go the extra mile and to dive in and learn Angular and integrate it with my page. I am glad I did that because I got a new, fancy framework on my resume by taking on the extra work. On top of that, I got a great working of example of the shiny UI which was a great show piece. It showed that I was interested in new technologies and applying them to the work I did daily. It was also a great talking point during the interview. It gave me the chance to show that I could learn a new skill in a short amount of time and apply it meaningfully.\\nYou may find that you are stretching your resume to meet the requirements of a job. If you find yourself in this situation, then consider doing some open source work or applying for an internship. Both of these experiences will give you the valuable opportunity to contributed to a larger codebase. It also shows that you can collaborate with other people in a codebase. This is a skill most companies look for when hiring since it is vital for thriving in most modern tech companies.',\n",

       "  'article': 'I would first like toThank Youfor taking the time out to read my first “official” blog post! Since this isTHE FIRSTI think I should give a somewhat brief introduction on who I am, why I decided to start blogging, what you can expect from my blog, and why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”.\\nI am originally from Washington D.C. (born and raised), but decided to relocate to Charlotte N.C at the beginning of 2018 to start a new life in a city that I was somewhat familiar with. I had heard that the Tech scene in Charlotte had been developing and since my contract with Georgetown University was ending soon I felt like that was the universe giving me the green light to take a chance and start over fresh. I was able to secure an apartment for my boys and I and immediately started the dreadedJOB SEARCHafter. I had been meeting with different recruiting agencies, sending out hundreds of resumes, and it always ended with similar if not the same results…\\nCan you say discouraging! I began to doubt myself and my decision to move my little family to Charlotte. One day, I decided to try a different method of getting my foot in the door of one these tech companies. I decided to research companies in Charlotte and find the top five that I would like to work for and look up developers who were already working there on LinkedIn and introduce myself that way! Hey, they say sometimes its not what you know but who you know that gets you in, and what did I have to lose? Luckily, the first developer I messaged on LinkedIn immediately responded back. He informed me that the company he worked for was currently not hiring but he recommended that I join a local meetup group called the “Charlotte Devs”. He said that they might be able to assist me on my job search. I wasted no time joining the meetup group and was added to the slack workspace. I introduced myself right away and shared how the interview process had lowered my confidence and how I really just wanted to find a great company that saw my potential and would be willing to invest in my growth. Moments later I received a private message that reassured me that Charlotte was where I belonged.\\nUmmm, YES PLEASE!!! By this time I had heard amazing stories about the Skookum culture and how it was voted one of the number one places to work in Charlotte. I was soo excited!\\nOk, let’s fast forward 6 months into my internship at Skookum, which was originally suppose to only be a 6 week contract role (big smile)! At this point I’m full of nerves because the internship is almost over and I didn’t know whether or not I was going to have a job offer in the end. I couldn’t sleep. Anxiety started to set in. I turned to twitter for motivation and to reassure me that “I’VE GOT THIS”. As I sat in bed reading everyones testimonies about how coding had changed their lives I decided to post a tweet to remind myself of how far I’ve came and to let others know that with determination and desperation you can change your situation. I woke up the next morning and my tweet have went viral! I was amazed that what had seemed like such a simple tweet to me resonated with soo many people. This was thousands of strangers telling me how proud they were of me, that they were rooting for me, and hadNEVERmet me in person. My day had been made.. or so I thought. I went in to work and shared what had happened with a few of my coworkers who were just as excited and shocked as I was. By the end of the day I received the message I had been anticipating…a slack message from the Engineering Director asking to meet with me. I instantly thought “aww man let me find a box to toss my stuff in” LOL. I can’t remember how long we talked honestly because I was soo nervous that it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion and then I heard it… we would like to keep you onFULL-TIMEas a Software Engineer!! Tears of joy burned my face because even though my learning journey wasn’t over I had finally found a company that believed in me and wanted to help me grow! A viral tweet and I was brought on full-time that same day!! November 28th was honestly the best day for me in 2018. Since I was now officially a Skookum employee I had decided to share my story with my coworkers since the tweet sparked some curiosity and they were already aware that I had taken a non-traditional route into tech (Self Taught). After hearing my story I was asked if it would be ok to publish my story on the Skookum blog and of course I said “YES”. Since then the article and my tweet have been shared all over the different social media platforms, it’s been featured in different tech newsletters, and shared on other websites.

It is committed to building industry infrastructure, breaking the application threshold of blockchain technology and facilitating more external resources to enter the blockchain industry. Over the past year, ONEROOT has successively developed a decentralized transaction protocol R1, a distributed decentralized exchange DDEX, a distributed centralized exchange DCEX, high-performance public chains RNC, a user terminal Touch Wallet and other products, which have won recognition from top international partners in the industry.\\nMutual benefits and shared achievements are the consistent concept of ONEROOT, of which the core is fair and efficient transfer of value. RNT is the bridge connecting all links of the ecosystem, and therefore has a solid value base. With the rapid development of the blockchain industry, ONEROOT ecosystem continues to expand. As a result, the service targets have become more diversified, and new application scenarios have been emerging. Meanwhile, the functions and positioning of RNT have also changed. To this end, we have refined the application scenarios, clarified the relationship between supply and demand, and explained the value base of RNT from the function aspect.\\nTransaction Scenario\\nTransaction is the most mature application scenario in the blockchain industry and one of the main development directions of ONEROOT. Insufficient liquidity along with high development and maintenance costs is a challenge for all exchange operators. Guided by the concept of mutual benefits and shared achievements, ONEROOT’s trading solutions allow operators holding traffic to quickly deploy distributed exchanges, share transaction data and liquidity, meanwhile, improving transaction efficiency and greatly reducing the cost of R&D and maintenance as well as access to traffic of operators. As DDEX and DCEX bring together more and more exchanges, all participants will win through sharing.',\n",

       "  'article': 'I have been practicing agile for a few years now, and over the years I have come to form a few opinions / beliefs of my own. Specifically where things can go wrong in agile and where things can be improved in the process. Before going forward If you haven’t practiced agile you may have a few questions —\\nThere are several implementations of agile, scrum being one of the most popular and one which I have been adopting for the past few years. Something I have noticed that is done by most people (my self included) while following agile, is that they often skip major steps or values that are core to the agile process. And such things result in agile being practiced in very unproductive/counter-productive and frustrating ways for both developers and product owner.\\nLet’s take the most popular agile implementation — scrum.The basic values essential to scrum are :\\nCourage could be realized in many different ways. Courage is shown by disagreeing with something the product owner wants (with reason of course). Courage is shown by accepting failure and being honest with the product owner when something does not work out as planned or expected. Courage is shown by saying “NO” to product owner when asked to take more tasks than you can handle. Courage is shown by disagreeing or pointing out flaws to your team or superiors. Courage is also shown by rigorously defending what you believe or know to be true and even more courage is shown by accepting and realizing what you knew, held or believed to be true isactually wrong!\\nAll this may seem like something that is up to an individual, but I think it to be quite different. I believe that ideally in a scrum team all members must create a platform on which members are encouraged to put forward their ideas, thoughts, arguments, and concerns before a team comfortably and without any repercussions. Some members may voice their concerns or thoughts no matter what, as it’s in their nature while others may try to hide behind the ones that do so and simply nod away.',\n",

       "  'article': 'As with many other amateur writers, my writing is first a personal exercise. It’s my way to process what I see, organize my thoughts and understand my world. It helps me have a prepared mind when investing and supporting portfolio companies. My predictions for the year are notes to self, as subjective and informed as for the next VC’s opinion. I submit these thoughts so you know me better and somewhat understand what I do. I post these predictions to start the conversation for the year in Latin American tech — plus it’s a fun exercise.\\nIf last year felt confusing sometimes depressing, this year will feel worse. The world will face new challenges under terrible leadership. Absent a violent and unexpected shock, the US will fare well economically but will probably have a year of reckoning dealing with its daemons. Fred Wilson has abold predictionon this. A global bear market coupled with unprecedented volatility will mostly spare the startup economy more vigorous after a rally of IPOs in the first half of the year.\\nDespite the resilience, global venture capital will appear more scarce due to more cautious investors and global volatility. Investors tend to focus on portfolio allocation and follow-on rounds when going through an economic downturn. One unexpected consequence of US travails may be American tech investors seeking additional diversification outside of the US either by pushing portfolio cos to expand internationally or by investing directly in high growth verticals in promising markets. They will realize Uber IPO premium price on Lyft comes not from US market leadership but from international exposure. Silicon Valley investors that ventured outside of the comfort of the bay area will begin to outperform peers. LPs will take note. I think the massive trend of venture capital globalization as seen below will get stronger this year.\\nIn this context colored by our own national complications, Latin American tech will cement all the progress made during thefantastic 2018. I think total VC investment for this year will miss last year’s mark while the number of deals will go up.\\nIn a nutshell, if nothing terrible happens, 2019 will feel like a long year but one where Latin American tech has a chance to thrive. Bring it all!',\n",

       "  'article': 'Summary\\nVVPAT’s purpose is to provide a voter verified paper trail to audit whether EVMs have recorded votes correctly. So proper audit with an adequate sample size is the essential aspect of using VVPATs and without proper audit VVPAT may become just a tool to fool voters giving them a false sense of verifiability & scrutiny. ECI has not been carrying out proper audit or even its July 2017 decision of 5% audit in the elections in last one and a half years. And if mismatch is detected in the arbitrary miniscule audit of 1 booth/constituencyECI EVM VVPAT manual July 2018doesn’t even have a direction or clause to do/allow the necessitated full VVPAT audit . ECI has also vehemently opposed several cases by various parties in courts requesting for proper audit. Courts have evaded responsibility by leaving discretion to ECI & has failed to make ECI accountable. Mainstream media have remained silent even on grave issues like mass voter deletion & widespread mismatch in votes counted & polled suggesting EVM error/rigging in elections. In such an environment in which the Elections with EVM VVPAT technology is made unaccountable , the transparent & time tested Paper ballots must be preferred. Use of EVM VVPAT should not be allowed without proper , statistically sound audit & election rule for necessitated full VVPAT tally on mismatch in sample audit. Merely focusing on EVM ban has allowed grave issues of EVM VVPAT use to go unnoticed & unquestioned.\\nA Voter checks at the time of voting whether the paper record of his vote is correct by verifying the VVPAT printout. The check whether the vote has been correctly recorded by the EVM is done by tallying aka auditing an adequate & statistically sound sample of this VVPAT slips. VVPAT Mismatch means the votes recorded by VVPAT & EVM don’t tally. This is definite evidence of EVM error or EVM rigging. So if any mismatch occurs in the representative sample audited, it suggests that the results by EVM counting in the constituency is wrong & hence a full 100% VVPAT count of all booths of the constituency is essential to find the people’s mandate or result. The most important elements of a valid audit are adequate sample size , transparent & independent randomization & full VVPAT tally on any mismatch.\\n(Describing more on VVPAT here as most voters & even political party leaders doesn’t seem to have enough info about VVPAT, Significance of proper randomization , Meaning of mismatch & Necessity of full audit on mismatch — This also shows why paper ballots are much preferred. )\\nECI currently only allows VVPAT audit of 1 booth /constituency. In most constituencies this comes to about 0.4% of VVPATs used. For example in Gujarat election there were 50128 booths for 182 constituencies. So about 0.36%. aka 182/50128 booths were allowed to be audited there.',\n",

It can be pretty shameless. Some startups make no attempt to evolve beyond something that already exists. Sure, in business it’s good to benchmark your competition. But what seems to go on in a few places around Berlin isn’t benchmarking, it is straight copying.\\nI find this sad for a few reasons. Startup employees with genuine creativity who care about providing value to customers and shareholders feel like their internal flame is being slowly extinguished at a clone factory.\\nIt’s also not a good way to mentor young people just entering employment by teaching them that they shouldn’t think for themselves but instead switch-off their robust brains and just copy. What will these workers be like in 10-20 years time when they’ll most likely be needed to use their creative problem solving brains? And demonstrate true leadership skills? This just feels damaging for long-term career development. What happens when Germany’s workforce has a fat layer of mid and senior level managers who are only skilled at copying?\\nOn the other hand, buyers — including German consumers — deserve better than cheap knock-offs being pushed to try and position a startup for a quick high priced acquisition for founder paydays and investor profits.',\n",

       "  'article': 'The challenge of education is complex. How can the knowledge and skills of an expert be deconstructed into a format that can be understood by a novice, and then built up in a way that transforms the novice into an expert? How to ensure genuine retained understanding, memory, ability and transferrable intelligence? And how to do it at scale?\\n“This is only possible by combining effective instruction (teaching), cognitive science and neuroscience, and technology (artificial intelligence) — in one solution,” summarizes Guy Riese, Forbes 30 under 30, CEO and CoFounder ofUp Learn. “If you take just one of those you can have a good product. If you take two, it can be great. If you take all three and do it right, you solve education.”\\nIt all started when Riese fell ill at the beginning of his A Levels and missed an entire term. Keen not to move down a year, he searched the internet for ways to catch up and came across research on effective learning in the field of cognitive science. He applied these insights to his studies and rose from below average grades to top of his year in Maths, Chemistry, and Physics. He went on to achieve straight A*s, scoring 100% in Physics and secured a place at Imperial College London to study Mechanical Engineering. Riese then graduated with 1st Class Honours and a dissertation on Machine Learning.\\n“The secret to my success, and why some students get A*s, whilst others get Cs and Ds, has not been because ofwhatI’ve learnt, it’s beenhow.” I founded Up Learn to create a system for making the most effective learning experience in the world accessible to all”.\\nUp Learn is building a product that delivers education success at scale, starting with A Levels. It consolidates thousands of learning resources in one system. The content created by Up Learn teachers is fuelled by research into cognitive science, which ensures its efficiency and efficacy.',\n",

DApp이 비즈니스 로직을 업데이트할 수 있다는 점, 두 가지 이유를 통해 스마트 컨트랙트의 ‘Upgradeability(업그레이드 가능성)’의 필요성에 대해논의한 후, Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework가 만족시켜야 할 조건들과 Storage, Function Call 그리고 DelegateCall의배경지식을 살펴보았습니다. 이후, Proxy와 Registry를 이용한 Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework를설명했습니다.\\nUpgradeable Smart Contract Framework(이하 USCF)을 이용하면, Atomic한 업그레이드와 동일한 Entry point를 통해 DApp 서비스의 질을 크게 향상시킬 수 있습니다. 하지만 여전히 서비스 운영에 있어 개발자의 어려움이 남아 있습니다. 업그레이드 가능한 서비스를 운영하기 위해서는 개발자가 USCF에 대한 모든 배경 지식을 알고 있어야 한다는 점입니다. 실제 서비스는 여러 컨트랙트들로 이루어져 있는 경우가 대부분이기 때문에 모든 컨트랙트들과 각 컨트랙트들에 해당하는 Proxy 컨트랙트들을 일일이 관리해야 하며, 배포 단계에서 배포와 업그레이드 함수 호출의 순서를 알고 있어야 합니다.\\n이러한 프레임워크에 대한 배경지식들은 진입 장벽이 되어 개발 속도를 현저히 떨어뜨립니다. 그렇다면 기존에 존재하던 여러 프레임워크들은 어떤 방식을 취하고 있을까요? 프레임워크는 그들만의 도구가 존재합니다.\\n가깝게는 스마트 컨트랙트 테스트시 사용하는Truffle Framework를 살펴볼 수 있습니다. Truffle Framework는 자바스크립트 테스트 도구인mocha를 사용하여 스마트 컨트랙트 테스팅 방법론을 제시합니다. 기존에 많이 쓰이는 mocha의 형태를 따라가기 때문에 직관적인 장점이 있지만, 스마트 컨트랙트를 테스팅 하기 위해서는 여러 전처리 작업이 필요합니다. 컴파일, 배포, 블록체인과 연결, 주소 저장 등의 작업은 필수적이지만 매 테스트 시 설정하기에는 상당히 번거롭습니다. 이를 위해, Truffle Framework는truffle cli tool를 함께 제공하여 전처리 작업을 자동화합니다. 사실상 이 도구가 없으면 이 Framework를 사용하기에 많은 제약이 있다고 할 수 있습니다.',\n",

More than this, anthropologists have done the much-needed work of exploring the complexities aroundclimate change,gender struggles,gun violence,migration,genetics and race, and the rise ofauthoritarian governments. Here, SAPIENS takes a look at some of the major contributions of the field this year, from the current events that anthropologists have helped us understand more fully to the discoveries that brought new insights into what it means to be human.',\n",

In addition to education, like many, I chose to immigrate because I wanted to explore opportunities; to unleash my potential where it counts.\\nAs an immigrant, there are many challenges you face. Paperwork processes were one of them, as it was hard to understand what needed to get done and when. However, the number one challenge I faced when I arrived in the U.S. was language. The ability to communicate in words and understand gestures used in daily conversations — you can’t just translate words directly. There’s more to it. All countries have slang and that’s not just something you learn in class or through a podcast. It’s something you learn when engaging with locals. To add to this, understanding the thought process behind the language and gestures; the psychology. Why people say certain things, what people want to hear, etc.\\nBecoming an entrepreneur wasn’t my first thought, nor was it my second or third. I just always had a passion for building things. Since early childhood, I was building things. I always wanted to be in a competitive space and to do something that challenged me and allowed me to further develop my skills. The harder the task was, the more exciting it became to me. Having said that, I became an entrepreneur as a result of my personal experiences. When I set out to study abroad and immigrate to another country, I faced a long list of obstacles. From obtaining the right information about schools and programs to applying for a visa, it was hard. Through this experience, I recognized there is a huge lack of product and software services in this particular area (EdTech). I took it upon myself to launch something; a technical solution to the problem — To challenge myself.',\n",

       "  'article': '6 years ago, I made a crazy decision to join my Dad and was since thrusted into this vaguely familiar industry of transporting goods. As a kid, I spent my school holidays tagging my “uncles” who drove me around, making deliveries to hotel chains, supermarkets and warehouses. As the new “ah sia kia” (rich guy son) or “towkay kia” (boss’ son) in the office, one of my biggest challenge was to work with the same “uncles” who watched me grew up.\\nWhat really amazed me when I first plunged into this Supply Chain industry full-time was literally the tonnes of problems I had to solve. I mean, how hard could it be to move goods from one point to another, right? WRONG! I was fascinated by the complexity behind, yet at many times, simply couldn’t understand many of the “hard rules” that people just follow blindly and comply to. Why can’t we do things in another way that can possibly save us more time and efforts?\\nIn 2013, I made my 2nd crazy decision to start a Container Haulage business, after my first year in the family business. It was (and still is) very common to get this: “Just follow my way of doing things, when Uncle was doing this, you were still drinking milk.” How best to move away from that than getting into an entirely new business unit that even my Dad is not familiar with? Being young and ambitious, I thought, “How hard can it be to move Containers right?” WRONG AGAIN!\\nI finally understood why my previous contractors were always failing me, why containers are always “On The Way” or that somehow their trucks were either always having a “technical breakdown” or “tyre pangcek” (punctured). It was a challenging job with customers not being able to understand the pains behind your operational incapability.\\nIt was indeed a problematic headache. Despite that, I soldiered on alone, got my hands dirty, spent many sleepless nights alone in my office figuring out how to resolve the countless operational issues with the limited network that I had. I built and scaled the business to a sizeable fleet of 15 trucks within 3 years, and in 2016, I thought I managed to resolve the problem. Not enough truck to service customers,? Just buy more! Invest more! Soon, I began to realize that the larger my business grew, the more problems I had.',\n",

But, what if your stereo never had a remote in the first place, or it doesn’t work for your volume control setup? Plenty of vintage stereos sound great and can be found at bargain prices, but lack fancy modern conveniences like a remote control. If you find yourself with one, you canfollow Redditor justikowski’s lead and add a motorized remote volume control mechanism.\\njustikowski’sstereois used for all of their living room audio needs, but the setup doesn’t have any remote volume control. They couldn’t just purchase a universal remote, because the stereo simply doesn’t have the capability. It might have been possible to hack the stereo itself to add that functionality, but the solution they came up with is easier — and it looks cool as heck.\\nThe solution is to set upan Arduinowith an infrared receiver, and have it spin a stepper motor. A belt loops around the motor’s output and the stereo’s volume knob. The Arduino can be programmed to accept infrared commands from any button on any remote, so it’s easy to use whatever remote you already have on hand. The Arduino and motor are packed into a simple3D-printedenclosure made from black ABS, so it blends in seamlessly with the other devices on the entertainment center.',\n",

These snowflakealtcoinsare well suited to specific uses, though they’re not right for everyone.\\nHowever, when we decide which cryptocurrencies to list on Luno, one of our requirements is that they have a clear potential for mass adoption and are already showing consistent, long-term market traction. Basically, we need to be sure lots of people want to use them and will keep using them. That means that altcoins we might support have to solve a real problem.\\nIt’s often said that technology adoption follows a bell curve with defined stages as different people start catching on.\\nIt usually begins withinnovators: those on the cutting edge of technology who are in the know about brand new developments. They’re followed byearly adopters, who tend to be young, well-educated and able to take risks before the early majority move in; think hipsters, but less concerned with the price of avo-toast and more concerned with technological advancements. Although slightly more risk-averse, these people are nonetheless open-minded and susceptible to the influence ofearly adopters.

It’s usually at this point that the real (read: annoying) hipsters scorn said technology in favour of some long-gone nostalgia.',\n",

Disruptive technologies and a fear of the unknown is making it increasingly difficult for even the most progressive leaders and their organisations, to thrive. With less and less time to think more innovatively, those expected to lead are struggling to sustain productivity, performance and relevance — both personally and collectively.\\nA curious mindset however, offers leaders a new outlook. An optimistic one.\\nOUR ECONOMY IN MOTION\\nCatalysed by the rise of automation, a new economic era is emerging. In the past, we have given names to economies based on the main skills or attributes needed to sustain economic growth. For example, the Industrial Age was mainly sustained by machines and more recently the Knowledge Economy was powered by the use of human knowledge to create technology and new systems. Now with disruptive technologies on the rise, we are questioning the role of the human in the workforce, furthermore how industry will need to shift for humans to thrive in this emergent economy — the Human led Economy.\\nThe key to organisations successfully making the transition to the Human led Economy will be in how well they instil a mindset of curiosity, how well the…',\n",

       "  'article': 'I would first like toThank Youfor taking the time out to read my first “official” blog post! Since this isTHE FIRSTI think I should give a somewhat brief introduction on who I am, why I decided to start blogging, what you can expect from my blog, and why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”.\\nI am originally from Washington D.C. (born and raised), but decided to relocate to Charlotte N.C at the beginning of 2018 to start a new life in a city that I was somewhat familiar with. I had heard that the Tech scene in Charlotte had been developing and since my contract with Georgetown University was ending soon I felt like that was the universe giving me the green light to take a chance and start over fresh. I was able to secure an apartment for my boys and I and immediately started the dreadedJOB SEARCHafter. I had been meeting with different recruiting agencies, sending out hundreds of resumes, and it always ended with similar if not the same results…\\nCan you say discouraging! I began to doubt myself and my decision to move my little family to Charlotte. One day, I decided to try a different method of getting my foot in the door of one these tech companies. I decided to research companies in Charlotte and find the top five that I would like to work for and look up developers who were already working there on LinkedIn and introduce myself that way! Hey, they say sometimes its not what you know but who you know that gets you in, and what did I have to lose? Luckily, the first developer I messaged on LinkedIn immediately responded back. He informed me that the company he worked for was currently not hiring but he recommended that I join a local meetup group called the “Charlotte Devs”. He said that they might be able to assist me on my job search. I wasted no time joining the meetup group and was added to the slack workspace. I introduced myself right away and shared how the interview process had lowered my confidence and how I really just wanted to find a great company that saw my potential and would be willing to invest in my growth. Moments later I received a private message that reassured me that Charlotte was where I belonged.\\nUmmm, YES PLEASE!!! By this time I had heard amazing stories about the Skookum culture and how it was voted one of the number one places to work in Charlotte. I was soo excited!\\nOk, let’s fast forward 6 months into my internship at Skookum, which was originally suppose to only be a 6 week contract role (big smile)! At this point I’m full of nerves because the internship is almost over and I didn’t know whether or not I was going to have a job offer in the end. I couldn’t sleep. Anxiety started to set in. I turned to twitter for motivation and to reassure me that “I’VE GOT THIS”. As I sat in bed reading everyones testimonies about how coding had changed their lives I decided to post a tweet to remind myself of how far I’ve came and to let others know that with determination and desperation you can change your situation. I woke up the next morning and my tweet have went viral! I was amazed that what had seemed like such a simple tweet to me resonated with soo many people. This was thousands of strangers telling me how proud they were of me, that they were rooting for me, and hadNEVERmet me in person. My day had been made.. or so I thought. I went in to work and shared what had happened with a few of my coworkers who were just as excited and shocked as I was. By the end of the day I received the message I had been anticipating…a slack message from the Engineering Director asking to meet with me. I instantly thought “aww man let me find a box to toss my stuff in” LOL. I can’t remember how long we talked honestly because I was soo nervous that it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion and then I heard it… we would like to keep you onFULL-TIMEas a Software Engineer!! Tears of joy burned my face because even though my learning journey wasn’t over I had finally found a company that believed in me and wanted to help me grow! A viral tweet and I was brought on full-time that same day!! November 28th was honestly the best day for me in 2018. Since I was now officially a Skookum employee I had decided to share my story with my coworkers since the tweet sparked some curiosity and they were already aware that I had taken a non-traditional route into tech (Self Taught). After hearing my story I was asked if it would be ok to publish my story on the Skookum blog and of course I said “YES”. Since then the article and my tweet have been shared all over the different social media platforms, it’s been featured in different tech newsletters, and shared on other websites.

This gives dealerships the ability to make the right decisions on what to purchase, every time.\\nIf you ask 10 “Car Dog” dealers if they made better margins on selling cars in 1998 than 2018, 10 of them will say some variation of “ABSOLUTELY”. The acquisition epidemic that dealers are being faced with today comes down to four things.\\nWith Drivably, dealers will now have access to new rental, fleet, and private inventory that is designed to meet their needs. Because of Drivably’s extensive relationships across these various channels, they are able to analyze hundreds of thousands of units every single day. Drivably can tell dealerships what inventory they need, regardless of where is sits in the US and due to their friendly approach to the private market, they have the ability to tap into 15 million private market units that most dealers don’t currently have access to.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Ever since Apple swiped left on the home button andintroduced new gesturesinstead, iPhone gestures have become more important than ever for mobile app design. Every iPhone gesture means something about your user: whether they know where to tap and how to navigate, what features they’re interested in, and what frustrates them. If you could see and understand these interactions, you’d know exactly how to make your app better and which UI elements need improvement. That’s wheretouch heatmapscome in.\\nTouch heatmaps are the mobile industry’s standard for assessing UI and the usability of iPhone gestures. They allow mobile teams to gain an in-depth understanding of user behavior at a glance: what areas users interact with most, what UI elements catch their attention first, and what causes them to quit or abandon the app. InGartner’s recent Market Guide for Web and Mobile App Analytics, they are called a “struggle detection tool”.\\nHow do mobile touch heatmaps work?\\nTouch heatmaps collect, measure, and aggregate every touch interaction users made on each screen of the app. Then, this aggregation is displayed on each screen in the form of a visual overlay of a gradient. Areas colored in blue represent areas with low user interaction, and areas colored in red show a high level of user interaction.\\nHere are five ways to use touch heatmaps to improve your mobile app’s iPhone gestures.',\n",

The device uses a motor to turn a 3D-printed spool at high speed, pulling thread from a much larger spool positioned vertically at the other end of the assembly. To keep things threaded evenly, a feeding arm is rotated back and forth using a servo.\\nAs the thread travels through the assembly, it spins an encoder disk that allows it to sense just how much thread is applied to the smaller roller. AnArduino Unois used for controlling the machine, along with a custom PCB shield. User interface is provided by a small OLED display that shows thread length, as well as a rotary encoder with a pushbutton input. The device features a manual winding mode, plus a mode that enables it to wind a predefined length of thread.\\nThe circuit and code for the buildcan be found here, and print files arelisted on Thingiverse. Parts used are available in the video description if you’d like to create your own, or perhaps you could apply something seen here to your next project!',\n",

       "  'article': 'So it’s the second day of 2019, we’ve launched the company, it’s the only thing that I’ve thought about for the last few years and it finally happened, in September last year we went live with our soft launch after nearly 12 months of 5 am starts and long nights. The day we ended for Christmas, we saw the first transaction through the platform — an awesome feeling and a great achievement.\\nSo, why are we doing what we’re doing? Why — we believe that buying your new home should be easy, transparent and fun. That is why I started making my way down this path in the first place.\\nSo, let’s start from the beginning. As a result of my training as an architect, I’ve always had an eye for design and detail, I’m the kind of guy that walks down the street and notices that the detailing on a building is asymmetrical and then proceeds to tell all his friends about it (yep, I’m a riot at parties!). So when I joined Shape Real Estate as Sales and Marketing Director at 24, in hindsight, a role I was massively under-qualified for, my naive, wide-eyed self wanted to make an impression, and an impression I made. Having come from a world of design, I believed that through good story-telling you could sell anything, even £1m+ apartments. I convinced the board that if we doubled the marketing budget, I could create a narrative around the building which would lead them to sell more quickly and therefore recoup the overspend. I did things very differently to normal marketing campaigns — I created the first ‘pop-up’ marketing suite in Piccadilly Circus station, put on a street party and created various guerilla campaigns. We improved sales, but not enough to justify the overspend. The market stagnated and buyers couldn’t have cared less about the story they just wanted to buy a place and get through the process unscathed — I was definitely not the employee of the month.\\nSo, why am I telling you this? I’ve always had an entrepreneurial spirit. Entrepreneurs look for broken things that matter to people. Holes in the fabric of life that could be patched with ingenuity and a bit of effort to make life easier for everyone. So after the confidence knock I took from the marketing budget escapade, I was back on my feet and back looking for broken things to fix.\\nOne thing I did notice when dealing with all of these property transactions was the fear and confusion in the eyes of the buyers, as they approached such a milestone in their lives. A young couple hand-in-hand walking towards the marketing suite with a smile from ear to ear, only for the happiness to drain from their faces when they are told: “now, you need a conveyancer, an AIP, searches need to be done, enquiries made, exchange contracts and don’t forget insurance, oh, and you have 28 days to get it done, bye!” I realised there that must be a better way.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Let’s start this post rightwhere we left off with part 1— with a quick recap of Bostrom’s conclusions inSuperintelligence: that Human Level Machine Intelligence will definitely be developed at some point — probably within the next 60 years — and will rapidly self-improve to Super Intelligence which will be able to outsmart humans to achieve its goals. The best shot we have of programming the SI’s goals to avoid total existential catastrophe is to achieve international cooperation in SI development and then tell the SI to “achieve that which we would have wished the SI to achieve if we had thought long and hard.”\\nI find this conclusion (and the entire book, really) to be quite terrifying. And, that was clearly Bostrom’s desired effect — to convince readers that the advance of artificial intelligence is an epically important topic that should be invested in and carefully studied. Bostrom is not shying away from fear mongering when he writes:\\nAs the first phase of my response toSuperintelligence, I’d like to run through all the ways that Bostrom successfully freaked me out.\\nFirst, that “failure” meansirreversible existential catastrophe; as Bostrom puts it, we only experience an existential catastrophe zero or one times. Second, that we can fail in so many different ways — we can fail if the SI developers are evil, self-interested, or plain old ignorant. And the people who first develop SI will likely be the only developers of SI because the exponential rate of improvement after the crossover point means that the first SI that is developed will achieve a “decisive strategic advantage” over other projects. Really, we can fail insomanyways — in part 1 of this post, I listed a tiny portion of the dystopic possible outcomes that Bostrom lays out.\\nThe third thing that freaks me out is the general uncertainty surrounding this whole endeavor. Bostrom uses the qualifier, “assuming we aren’t totally oblivious to ___,” concerningly often. Bostrom’s vision of global cooperation seems highly uncertain when we consider the difficulty of reaching global agreements which limit an individual country’s military or economic strength. Also, the whole idea of telling the SI to do “that which we would have asked it to do if we had thought long and hard” is uncertainby design— it would mean creating an all-powerful entity with an unknown end-goal. The AI theorist, Eliezer Yudkowsky, calls this strategy Collective Extrapolated Volition (CEV) and describes it as:',\n",

Fortunately, robots are available for this job, meaning humans don’t always have to be directly involved in this labor intensive and even dangerous task. These robots, however, are extremely expensive.This project aims to constructan alternative to those that are on the market, with a structure that can adapt to pipes of various diameters.\\nThe robot that the team came up with uses a pair of three-wheel roller assemblies arranged at 120 degrees for contact along the pipe’s inner diameter. Each wheel is attached to a linkage assembly that connects it to a central spring, designed to contract and expand as necessary to maintain pressure on the pipe, even if the diameter changes. For locomotion, two of the three front wheels are driven by powerful gear motors, pulling the rest of the robot with it. Control is accomplished via anArduino Unoand an L298N H-bridge board.\\nAs of now, it’s been shown to work well 300mm and 320mm horizontal pipes, and can roll like a car through larger diameters as well. One could see this type of design expanded in the future with three- or six-wheel drive and perhaps active control of the wheel linkages. This could then allow for better maneuverability or use in vertical piping.',\n",

Can you tell us more about your background, and how long you’ve worked in agriculture?\\nMandla Nkomo:I am very passionate about two things: getting agriculture production right, and making sure we are creating opportunities for smallholder farmers to participate in global value chains. In other words, making it inclusive. I am actually a biochemist by training, with no formal training in agriculture, but agriculture has always been a passion. I started out working in a laboratory at an agriculture company, which allowed me to do both. When I transferred to Technoserve, I already knew, practically speaking, how integration works, and what the end user should do in terms of packaging the connections. Technoserve allowed people to do it at scale, across a number of companies and a number of value chains. Now I’m doing the same at Solidaridad, with a sharper focus on sustainability and value chains, and how digital can be leveraged.\\nAL: Can you give us some background on the goals of Solidaridad?',\n",

TheThird Industrial Revolution, called the “Digital Revolution,” was characterized by thedigitizationof data and widespread propagation of information. However, the Digital Revolution lacked adequate data security; digitized records were vulnerable to modification, deletion and theft.\\nToday, theFourth Industrial Revolutionis underway, and emerging technologies, such as blockchain, are not only securing digital transactions, but also forming an entirely new ecosystem. This novel ecosystem’s core components include the Internet of Things (IoT),Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and reimagined networks of shared computing services. Unprecedented advancements in communication and connectivity are generating an exponential quantity of data, renewing the need for security.\\nIndustry 4.0 technologiesare expediting the creation of a more secure data-driven digital ecosystem. Augmate is harnessing the power of IoT, blockchain, and AI to provide our users with device-to-device intelligence and enhanced human-to-machine connectivity.Augmate Connect, built from the ground up for IoT and wearables, is a next-generation device management platform that reduces the threat of endpoint vulnerability and hacking. Our technologies are contributing to a disruptive movement transforming business operations worldwide.\\nThe velocity of disruptive innovation is accelerating across all industries due todigital transformation. Customer-oriented experiences are central to the digital economy, as data-enhanced services and products are becoming the new normal. To keep up with these changes, organizations are forming innovation-focused partnerships. Strategic resource and knowledge sharing creates significant value for all parties, as well as the ecosystems in which they operate.',\n",

This solution can be anything your team wants to build. Hackathons are a place to learn from mentors and other like-minded people in your community.\\nAttending a hackathon changed my life for the better. I learned more in the 36 hours of continuous coding than I did in 1 year of schooling. They helped me add projects to my resume and introduced me to potential employers.

Therefore, its important for us to be able to open a spiritual window to rejuvenate with fresh air of transcendental bliss. The intended goal is to describe this window, which is covered by drapes of ignorance and conditioning, these drapes can be opened by process of Yoga and then light of transcendental knowledge and spiritual bliss shines through.\\nThe ‘spiritual technology’ was at it’s peak few thousand years back. It was highly developed and prevalent in practice. It was called ‘Yoga’ because it culminated the entire lifestyle of an Vedic society. Yoga means union of everything. Hence Yoga is the process, which defines and inculcates, every action a person (a Yogi) performs both individually and collectively as a member of an elite Yogic society.\\nUsing this spiritual technology humans had created a pristine civilization which lived in complete harmony with nature. Everyone had abundance of satisfaction and happiness. The technology in itself was sufficient in providing a long fulfilling and healthy life. It tapped into fulfilling the real needs of all living beings. It extracted from human beings their inherent sense of goodness and morality, via practical actions that suited the circumstances of their particular time and place.',\n",

I never waited for or had a sense of entitlement that my employer should pay for them. Over the past 16 years I have earned an alphabet soup of certifications including PMP, ITIL, CSM, CSPO, CSP, and SPC. Only the ITIL foundation certification was sponsored by a former employer, as they were offering it to all of their IT staff.\\nAt specific strategic points in my career I have leveraged my certifications to land key jobs that furthered my career. So, I certainly understand that certifications can help a candidate land a job.\\nWith so many candidates applying for positions, often a specific certification on a resume can make the difference between an application being considered or rejected based on specific filters. This can be especially important in certain technology areas where a very challenging certification demonstrates extensive knowledge and experience. Some great examples include the CISSP security certification and the CBAP certification for business analysts.\\nWhile certifications can play a role in getting considered for a job, many of them demonstrate little more than initiative. For example, consider the two first-level Agile certifications offered by Scrum Alliance: Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO). The CSM is obtained by attending a two-day course (by a Certified Scrum Trainer) and then passing an easy 40-question test. The CSPO is even easier. It is obtained merely by attending a two-day course taught by a Certified Scrum Trainer.\\nDon’t get me wrong. I took both of these courses and they were valuable to me. I have used material from each course, taught by very experienced and respected trainers, in subsequent roles as an Agile practitioner.',\n",

In the U.S., you could be more ambitious and more creative if you set your mind to it, but it required shifting to an abundance mentality that allowed you to dream.\\nOutside of college where I had a variety of jobs, I worked at the human rights organization,WITNESS.org, because I wanted to fuse documentary filmmaking and human rights work. This was at a time when YouTube didn’t yet exist (nor did digital cameras). WITNESS was the first group to envision the ubiquitous presence of cameras, and their potential for social transformation if held by human rights defenders. Peter Gabriel, the musician, conceived of the idea while traveling to South Africa in the 1980s. I joined in 2000 and got hooked on the role that media and technology could play in effecting change.\\nIt wasn’t a conscious choice at first — I would see a gap, look around to see who was filling it, and if there was someone doing so effectively in ways that interested me professionally or creatively or ethically I would join them (in the case of WITNESS, my first job), and if there wasn’t, I’d endeavor to do so directly.

I don’t know anyone named Gordon in my community so why would Google AI leaders think ‘gordo’ was a typo for ‘Gordon’ if it wasn’t because for their algorithms are written by a group of mostly white men.',\n",

Ugh.\\nThese inherent delays cause viewers to shy away from watching the big game on their computer or smartphone. Not only does this latency lead to poor viewing quality, but also the potential loss of consumers viewing content and sponsorships associated with the big game.\\nThis past year, Limelight Networks did a series of surveys exploring consumer opinions, insights, and behaviors surrounding digital content. How do individuals feel about the inherent delays in “Live-Streamed” Sporting Events?\\nAnd the amazing thing is59.3% of individuals globallystill subscribe to one or more Streaming Video on Demand (SVOD) service. Individuals want the ability to watch their favorite team play, no matter the time or the place.\\nWith the growth of social media, it is essential for media outlets to understand the needs and wants of these consumers.

This is tricky for some. It will often make beginners slow down and lose their natural talking rhythm; they’ll read in a one-word-at-a-time fashion, rather than read ahead and speak in phrases.\\nWhy doesn’t this happen to all voice actors who wear headphones? Their ear is above average. Not the cartilagey parts on the outside, best demonstrated by Alfred E. Newman. I’m talking about the intricate, delicate, hairy parts on the inside.\\nPeople who master the art of voiceover have “a good ear” above all else.\\nMy first agent in Los Angeles was Steve Tisherman. A genius in many respects, he was the agent who developed and subsequently managed the talents of voiceover titan Don LaFontaine. You may remember Don’s gravelly voice serving up the words“In a World”a few thousand times in the 90s and 2000s, yes? Steve Tisherman said to me in our very first meeting, “You want to whisper your way to million bucks? It’s not voiceover. It’s earover.”Earover? That’s not very catchy, Steve. But, what can I say, I was 29 at the time and had no idea what the hell this Hollywood agent was saying to me. Who did he think he was talking to!? I was anactor.I had MFA training! I’d completed Arthur Lessac’s Kinesensic Training for the voice! I played Hamlet at Cambridge! (Or rather, Marc Antony at Chicago Shakepeare!)

What used to be a process relegated for matchmakers, mixers, and clubs everywhere is now harnessed in the internet’s potential. No longer do you have to leave your home to find somebody special — you can scroll through an online marketplace of people on your phone, tablet or computer.One of my previous articles dictated how this has changed the dating game…\\n(…But it remained mum on the inevitable consequences artificial-intelligence will cause to human-relationships everywhere).\\nA quick scroll through search engines reveals where we’re at already.

       "  'article': 'Remember,Bostrom has taught usthat, in creating SI, we can “fail” [cause irreversible existential catastrophe] inmanyways; we face uncertainty at every turn; and we are leaving hugely important decisions about humanity’s future up to a robot, or up to humans who may not share our values. Bostrom asserts that these are inevitable facts; in this piece, I’m going to counter his determinism first with theory and then with real-world examples. Here it goes.\\nBostrom argues that it would be impossible to halt SI development because its incredible power will make it irresistible. Bostrom takes a deterministic standpoint in terms of technological development, in a similar way toJacques Ellul, a French philosopher and sociologist. InThe Technological Society, Ellul describes the deterministic adoption of new technologies by saying that individuals and states — in order to avoid being crushed or outcompeted by technological advance — must align themselves with it:\\nThis mechanism removes freedom of choice from individuals as well as from politicians and entire states. In this way, all individuals and institutions are roped into furthering technological advance and efficiency. For example, while self-driving cars will put millions out of work, the fact that some country would inevitably develop them (and if another country does it before the US, we will lose even more jobs and market share) propelledPresident Obama to propose spending $4 billion on research into self-driving cars. On an individual level, I spent years arguing the merits of the flip-phone and railing against the smartphone, and then I (like a classic technical slave) jumped on the smartphone train in order to compete for a promotion at work.\\nWe can see the mechanism Ellul describes all around us. But does that mean that it is inescapable? For Ellul, it is — he is a libertarian purist and believes that any type of collective action is a part of “technical slavery” and is unacceptable because it reduces his “freedom.” But in the face of a technology (SI) that wouldliterallyremove all decision-making power from all ofhumanity(and potentially end in existential catastrophe), we must set purism aside. We must accept the reduction of certain types of freedoms to avoid the ultimate reduction in human freedom! Now that we’ve decided it is okay to use collective organizing to control deployment of dangerous technologies, we can point to a few positive examples of this in human history: biological and nuclear weapons.\\nThe use of biological weapons was first regulated by the Geneva Protocol, which was later supplemented by the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) — to which 178 states have signed on (as of December 2016). The US enacted the Bioweapons Anti-Terrorism Act in 1989, which applies the convention to private citizens and criminalizes violations of the convention. Onemajorflaw with the BWC is that it lacks any formal method for monitoring compliance; it instead asks for voluntary annual reports. Negotiations towards an internationally binding monitoring system took place between 1995 and 2001, ending when the Bush administration decided that the US could not be bothered by such silly things as international agreements to prevent mass human suffering…',\n",

On one hand, you have the claims that by solution providers that jobs are not being lost, while other industry commentators claim that the benefits cannot be achieved without loss of jobs. What is the truth of the situation? Can they both be correct?\\nIs it possible both scenarios are actually correct and not entirely contradictory?\\nLet’s start with the optimistic view that automation simply eliminates the mundane tasks and provides the opportunity for more creative, complex and challenging new opportunities. This is explicitly describing that the nature of work will be changing. This is nothing new, in my experience, the advances in technology have been changing my job throughout my entire career.\\nFurthermore, both in the USA and UK the current levels of unemployment are at the lowest we’ve seen for decades. Japan faces an even more challenging situation where the population is in decline and therefore even filling existing roles as workers retire is an impossible task.\\nAt this early stage of development, the evidence points to RPA not having a significant impact on job losses. That’s not to say there are no winners and losers in this equation, as some industries clearly find themselves in a situation where their survival depends on cutting costs; staff and buildings being the top two savings opportunities.',\n",

Such innovation makes an organization more competitive and more efficient, often translating to more success and bigger profits, or in other cases — survival. Investing in those ideas comes at a cost, of course, including the risk that failure could leave you in a worse position than had you done nothing at all.\\nFortunately, advances in technology aimed at empowering business users have fundamentally redefined what’s achievable and, at the same time, has improved the probability weighted outcomes of business improvement initiatives. As a result, the assumptions that business leaders have traditionally used to calculate the costs of innovation — whether “back-of-the-napkin” or comprehensive models — are no longer valid. In fact, I contend that the “risk” of innovation has never been lower.\\nWhen business leaders have evaluated “innovation” opportunities for things such as process improvement, deeper customer engagement, or enhanced decisioning, they’ve generally considered six factors:\\nBut by reducing three key factors — cost, time, and resources required — business user driven work management technologies can also minimize the risk of outright failure. That means business leaders should recalibrate their assumptions about technology-based investment decisions, by increasing the probability of success. Higher probabilities combined with higher throughput of projects executed upon, can result in superior overall returns.\\nTechnology unleashes the power of innovation',\n",

There are more to it.\\nI make software in my daily life, and of course I get paid by my clients for it. But who pay for the iOS, macOS, and every software Apple makes? Unlike android phone manufacturers, who get their software freely from Google, Apple has to do it’s own R&D (Research and Development) and maintenance for its software. And yes it is very costly. According to appleinsider.com, in Q3 2018 Apple has spent $3.7 billion for R&D.\\nSo who pay for it? The answer is, Apple users do! Think about this, the price for every Apple products are including the software inside it. So if you buy an iPhone for lets say $800, maybe $200 in it is the software, and the phone without the software is only $600. That’s why you can’t find other phone using iOS, because they are selling the software too.\\nNot only the software inside the phone. You buy the maintenance and updates for those software too. Lets take iPad 2 which came out in 2011 and got its last iOS update at 2016. If you bought iPad 2 by 2011, you got update for 5 years without having to pay anything more. It’s like a subscription for 5 years that you pay in front.\\nApple fanboys are EVERYWHERE. No matter what apple do, the fanboy will buy their products. But how? How could people fall in love with “Apple” as a brand without thinking about the specs or anything else?',\n",

After completing an Analytics fellowship last summer, I joined the citywideAnalytics Teamas a full-time data and performance analyst.\\nMy fellowship gave me an inside perspective on what it takes to move a large data project forward and develop strong working relationships in the context of local government.\\nThinking of applying? In case you’re on the fence, here are my thoughts on what a summer at DoIT can offer.\\nAs a DoIT fellow, you will be stationed at the heart of timely, impactful work (not to mention the heart of Boston). During my fellowship, I worked with theBoston Public Health Commission (BPHC)to expand healthcare access in the City. Together, we built a web-based app to guide health insurance applicants through the enrollment process. At DoIT, you can grow as a data analyst without sacrificing your penchant for civic engagement.\\nDoIT fellowships are structured with your development in mind. A personal mentor will help you scope and execute a long-term project based on your personal interests. My mentor brought valuable experience in both data science and project management to my fellowship. She was — unwaveringly — in my corner, whether that meant proofreading an email, troubleshooting over coffee, or simply sharing stories of her own experience as a public servant. This summer, skip the busy work. DoIT will equip you with the time and tools to develop robust, polished deliverables.',\n",

This appears to be very common in thetwitterversebased upon a non-scientific twitter search of“holiday write code”.\\nWith technology, there are constant disruptions that if you do not pay attention to, you will quickly fall behind the disruption curve. One of the largest disruptions we have seen in recent years is the explosion of containers especially Kubernetes. If you are not aware of containers in 2019, you are definitely behind many in the technology field.\\nHow does a senior technical leader get deep enough to know the benefits of such a technology and when to apply them is a constant theme in my career. I decided in 2018 to shift gears in terms of my focus and spend more effort writing code during the year and not wait for the holidays. I wanted to focus on leveraging the latest technologies with the goal of expanding my knowledge base and to remain relevant in today’s economy. While I always considered myself apprised of the latest tech trends and could articulate the benefits of technology choices and architectures pretty well, I felt that I could do more.\\nSince I think there are many others in this space that are looking for ways to remain relevant and to understand what others in the tech industry are doing to stay current, I wrote my perspective on the past year as it relates to my career and technology.

He immediately noticed that she was a natural in front of the camera. “He suggested I talk to other photographers in the Seattle area, as apparently, he thought I posed well and more similar to a fashion model than someone having their senior photos done,” she said.',\n",

While we have the capabilities to solve most challenges, we also rely on open-sourcing which equips us with the right tools which allows us to find truly unique and innovate solutions to several problems.\\nThe team at Draup has been trying to solve the problem of stateful deletion/updation at the ORM level for Django. Whilst solving the problem, we also wanted to build a generic solution for ORM, so it could be used by Django-developers as well.\\nStateful deletion is when an object cannot be directly deleted, without a prior prompt message (when deleting a single object entity, the prompt message gesticulates all the other dependent objects tagged along with the parent entity, before deleting it).\\nStateful updation occurs while transferring object dependencies from one object entity to another object entity, through which duplicate entries from database-tables can be erased.\\nDraup Django is primarily a Pip Package. It provides stateful deletion/updation and is, availablehere.',\n",

As designers, we arm ourselves with all kinds of tools, techniques, and methodologies aimed at clearing the path of assumption so we can design for users, and not for ourselves. Still, assumptions are always out there, creeping in around the edges waiting for the right moment to slide in and cloud our judgment.\\nSometimes assumptions can be expensive. And there’s nothing like an assumption blowing up in your face to make you think twice about taking action without first having all the facts.\\nLast month I made an assumption based on good-natured intentions that ended up costing $500, some strained relationships, and 100 pounds of spoiled meat. Allow me to explain.\\nI live in the mountains where I rent a small carriage house above my landlord’s garage. I get to drink my morning coffee on a porch that sits at 7,500 feet and looks out at snow-capped peaks and miles of pine forest. Humblebrag aside, it is by far the most amazing place I have ever lived, and I’m super grateful that I get to call it home.\\nBecause of this, I have a lot of respect for the house, the property, and am in great standing with the landlord. So when he went out of town on a 10-day hunting trip this summer and left the light to one of the property’s outbuildings on, it only made sense to do the good-neighborly thing and shut the door — which was ajar — and turn off the light. Iassumedthat he had been working in the outbuilding during the day with the light on, and had forgotten to turn it off.',\n",

Shipping Lines, Forwarders, Terminal Operators, etc have salivated at the possibility of having such a predictable and efficient network, where import containers can go directly to the nearest exporter’s place without having to go to empty yards, where significant time is lost in finding the next trip.\\nNow, with improving visibility and formal data collection finally taking place in the segment, this dream is getting closer to becoming a reality. Containers going from an importer’s chemical factory to an exporter’s FMCG plant while getting cleared by a relayed container surveyor is becoming a reality!\\nThe, march towards this future is beginning with players trying to conquer certain clusters where they have visibility and control. So, during this early adopter stage, the various stakeholders are all entering the realm in different methods vying for the same outcome: an expansion in the space where they can directly cater to the freight owners, by connecting imports and exports in a single direct chain.\\nIn a country where more than 85% of long-haul freight moves by road transportation, the natural 1st layer elongation into the extended logistics segment is road logistics. These days’ road logistics is shifting towards efficient road optimization, where the truck can be optimized, while meeting predicted schedules.\\nThus the various stakeholders’ are looking to build their own lane cluster’s on routes they are familiar with, where they have a strong network and operational control. Operational control and a logistics network are the keys to operating a successful end to end logistics program, where additional cargo can be handled without significantly increasing costs.',\n",

Do they check it throughout the week for updates or announcements?\\nMaybe it’s time to sit back and evaluate the ways we spend our hours as church communicators. If we are waisting our time doing something. Let’s stop doing that thing. Sound good?\\nThe church app is one of those things that seems like a given at this point. Apps are for everywhere and for everything. If you use an app at your church, when it was first introduced, it was a source of pride that you could tell your congregation to find you in the App Store. But those days are gone. Apps have been around for a decade and now it’s an embarrassment if you don’t have one. Right?\\nChurch Apps fill the same role as any piece of technology. They are designed to serve a purpose and solve a problem. Do church apps still serve a purpose and solve a problem?',\n",

       "  'article': 'Itis astonishing to see the progression that Blockchain continues to make. With devoted adherents developing, refining, learning and executingconcepts to deployed applications, every day we come closer to interconnecting technology and services, one block at a time. As more power house giants and governments target new avenues, blockchain continues to flourish at an exponential rate similar to other technologies, as previously witnessed. Without a doubt 2019 will be a fascinating year for everyone involved in blockchain, and as a blockchain solutions company, we say that with confidence.\\nHere is a recap of the latest blockchain buzz last December.\\nThe Tunisian Internet Agency (ATI) has formed a strategic partnership with the Russian based platform, Universa, a new generation of blockchain technology that emphasizes on tokenization and contractual agreements. Such initiatives entail a 10 year renewable strategic partnership, where ATI will be providing hosting services to Universa to facilitate further development. What objectives can be expected? ATI will develop value added services in the blockchain field, digital economy, and digitization of paperwork. Likewise, Universa will aim it’s efforts to develop additional applications and services to integrate them into new tech platforms, create e- certification and the digital economy. Together both parties will also build projects with BaaS (blockchain as a service), an initiative that includes digital currency, digital identity, as well as e-governance and smart cities.\\nAs blockchain captivates the interest of more government based entities, the push for solutions using blockchain based applications become fairly synonymous with identity management, digitization of documents, and overall governance to interconnect services and technology together.\\nClickhereto read the full article',\n",

Part of the problem lies with a mixture of sophisticated methods used by scammers paralleled with a sentiment of urgency that comes from the fear of missing out. These factors conflate with misinformation campaigns designed to ensnare newcomers to the scene.\\nOne of the things throwing fuel on the fire is a basic lack of understanding. People who are just getting inducted into the scene often do not know how to manage public versus private keys, or which cryptocurrency exchanges are the right ones to set up an account at, and how to move their digital assets to a cold storage wallet. This basic lack of understanding means people are likely to ask questions, which makes them targets for malicious actors who use misinformation to socially engineer an attack.\\nAnother problem is that supposedly trustworthy sources of information often fail to weed out the scammers. For instance, compromised Twitter accounts, sometimes even those verified by the platform itself, have been known to successfully place promotional ads featuring links to known phishing scams. If people see an advertisement for a cryptocurrency scam as a promoted tweet, they will be more susceptible to believing that type of scam is legitimate; while they may not fall for it immediately, they may later reference that instance and fall for a different scam, misinterpreting the information from seeing a scam in a promoted tweet.\\nOne hopes that eventually this issue is something that will be managed from the inside out as cryptocurrency systems begin to scale outwards and compete with legacy remittance systems. Once that happens the user interface side is less likely to feature hexadecimal code keys which can be difficult for the human eye to differentiate from another.',\n",

       "  'article': 'A year ago, studies by We are social and Hootsuite revealed that the number of internet users worldwide exceeded 4 billion and the number of mobile phone users exceeded 5 billion. The average internet user was supposed to spend six hours a day using devices connected to the Internet — a quarter of his or her life. To sum it up, it would mean that in 2018 humanity spent one billion man-years on the Internet. And there is no evidence that this trend is slowing down. More and more accessible mobile Internet, better and better smartphones make us believe that in 2019 we will be even more actively integrating the Internet into our lives. This will be primarily caused bymobile applications.\\nWhile a few years ago there was a lot of talk about mobile Web, HTML5 standards, mobile browsers, today it is becoming more and more obvious that this is not the right way to go. Applications have won the users’ hearts, providing more convenient access to information, entertainment, and various practical functionalities.\\nMobile web became at best just an addition to the applications. Websites viewed on mobile browsers are first and foremost encourage users to install mobile apps. YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Pornhub, Allegro… Although they still work in the browser, they only show their full potential on the smartphone through their client applications. The same applies to every online shop — it’s great to have a mobile website, but the conversion rate from it is far lower than from a desktop site. Even small e-shops are commissioning mobile apps in the hope that they will find a new home on the smartphone’s start screen.\\nHowever, it is not only the convenience of the users that have influenced this situation. Another factor was the reduction in the cost of entering the market with a new mobile application. In 2018 only two mobile platforms remained on the market — iOS and Android. Mobile Windows, BlackBerry, Tizen or Firefox OS ceased to have any relevance. So there is no need to worry about them, no need to bear the additional costs of software development. Furthermore, React Native technology has reached maturity, thanks to which it is easy to build a mobile application that will work as well on Android as on iOS. It’s true, React Native has its limitations, but in the case of a typical enterprise or retail apps they’re not noticeable.\\nAnd on the horizon, you can see one more solution. Wherever the budget is not sufficient even for creating a React Native application, it becomes possible to use Progressive Web Apps. This kind of software is installed directly from websites, without the involvement of app stores. In many cases, Progressive Web Apps can provide users with more or less the same experience as the native app. And most importantly, these apps work well enough not only on Android but also on iOS.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Over the past thirty years, central banks focused on fighting inflation globally and have been failing. Given that inflation has been identified as the major culprit in most of the global depression since the 1920’s to today, no wonder most financial institutions have made it their target trying to control and manage it. However, it was the financial crisis of 2008 that led to deeper questioning of economic processes, credit system and debt management.\\nThe recession pointed out a gap in the public’ trust in financial institutions and governments due to the lack of transparency and accountability in financial world. The question on everyone’s mind is: will this stop, or it will continue? Are there any solutions out there that can prevent the collapse of financial fundamentals that are built around a centralised system? Not a question with an easy or short answer, but the smart money seems to be on blockchain architecture that is using cutting edge technology to build trust and transparency.\\nBlockchain platform are attracting the attention of financial service sector to its innovative technology that is set to change the future and it has emerged as a new paradigm in the financial industry. In 2016, the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicted that blockchain will revolutionize financial services, and build a solid platform where consumers and producers / buyers and sellers will converge. The financial sector however, is apprehensive considering the technology’s link to cryptocurrencies and evolving blockchain technology use in other sectors.\\nIn 2017, the banking sector and remittance industry experienced industry disruptions and large-scale mergers. By the end of the year, a consensus between the banking sector and blockchain technologists were reached. In the first quarter of 2018 several banks started adopting and testing the technology in phases. Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) has created the “internet of value” by empowering peer to peer, transparent, immediate and almost free exchanges of value over the internet awakening the banking industry the real possibility of their demise and effectively killing the stranglehold they have on the financial markets, not a pretty thought if you are involved in the finance business.\\nAccording to Statistics, from 2016 to 2021 it is estimated that blockchain technology is heating the global market aggressively, with the Blockchain industry market reacing 339.5 Million USD in size and is forecast to grow to 2.3 billion USD by 2021. Although banks and financial institutions have always been at the frontline of the technology evolution, it is very interesting to know they are preparing for a true battle. Who will win? Who will emerge triumphant and reap the spoils of war?',\n",

       "  'article': 'In the two years since we first launched Tech 2025, back in January 2017, we’ve learned that the primary reason people attend our events on any given topic is because they are curious about the topic or a particular aspect of the topic that we highlight in our event marketing.\\nMany of our attendees aren’t necessarily advanced in (or very knowledgeable about) the technologies we cover. They come to us curious, wanting to see something that sparks their internal, creative compass — even if they have no idea what that “something” might be. It’s safe to say that we’re all a bit overwhelmed with the number of disruptive emerging technologies emerging and developing simultaneously, each one promising to change global industries and the very nature of our reality in a mere next ten years: AI, machine learning, AR/VR/XR, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, gene-editing biotech, robots, automation — oy! Where to begin?! Imagining the future and your place in it has never been so complicated.\\nKnowledge is power, but curiosity is queen. As hard as it may sometimes be (we’re all busy and eternally distracted), in order to learn about the true potential impact of technology and to find our place in the ecosystem, we must feed our curiosity by constantly and substantively learning about the systems and ideas that are at the core of emerging technologies, including how global innovation happens, morals and ethics of businesses, corporate management and structure, societies and social science, etc. These technologies are challenging us to redefine who we are and what we want. The obvious question is: who are we and what do wereallywant?\\nDon’t let your curiosity go to waste. It’s your most powerful tool. It’s the anchor that will steady you in turbulent times as technologies and big ideas come and go. Learn and relearn what you thought you already knew. Revisit old concepts, learn new ones, and challenge current systems and ways of thinking. You don’t necessarily have to jump into the deep-end of the pool by taking expensive, months-long, courses in AI and machine learning that will require technical expertise you don’t have or necessarily want right now.\\nYou can start the new year learning about concepts at the core of emerging technologies or the industries that are adopting them. With this knowledge, regardless of the market volatility, you’ll be able to think through what’s happening now, how the latest developments might impact your business, and what’s coming next. I’ve gathered a short list of free online courses that helps us to see “the big picture” and focus on the problems emerging technologies are being created to solve, as opposed to the technology itself (and even the problems that are arising as we implement technologies like algorithmic bias).',\n",

Proscribed by my ethnicity from ever running on time, I just finally got around to putting up my new calendar. Anyway, here’s Your Humble Correspondent’s forecast for the next 363 days in all things blockchain-adjacent.\\nFor the record, this isn’t the calendar I just hanged on my fridge. 1902 Justus van Lieberg Trade Card Calendar front. Source: David Berry.\\nWhen other investments turn sour, crypto will taste sweeter and sweeter.You heard a lot about the stock market’s losing year, but it was really just a regression to the mean after 2017’s profit party. So I think the indices will track upward this year — slowly, measuredly upward. Stocks will be boring. Bonds might be more interesting, but that’s not a compliment. As yield curves flatten and perhaps invert, there’ll be a disincentive to fund long-term projects, which is economic kryptonite.Prediction: Money will flow into crypto as a hedge on the bigger money that flows into cash.\\nVocabulary will improve.Malta’s regulators distinguish between cryptocurrencies, security tokens and utility tokens. Other regulators will catch up. And the industry will then catch up to the regulators because what gets measured gets done.Everyone will be scrupulous to define what it is they’re trying to do with their ICO or STO.\\nRegulation will move forward, but un-regulation will move forwarder.Sovereign governments would be committing malpractice if they didn’t monitor the crypto space for KYC, AML, ATF and (especially) tax evasion concerns. So exchanges like Coinbase, which scrupulously adhere to all these standards, will continue to thrive by being a safe haven for institutional investors and other solid citizens who want to be — or at least appear — completely aboveboard with their crypto transactions. But let’s remember that “crypto” means “hidden,” and it was the whole Austrian-school, libertarian, borderline anarchical sentiment that fueled its adoption. Some people will still want to buy heroin straight from the poppy farmer. Others will want to transfer money to family in countries that don’t play nice with others. And still others will say it’s none of anyone’s goddamn business what I do with my money — it’smymoney. For them, decentralized exchanges which offer enhanced privacy at the risk of running afoul of regulators will grow vigorously in offshore havens.Those who want to demonstrate compliance will, but those who don’t won’t.',\n",

This was a revolutionary moment in the history of ecommerce, as it came to be known as the first purchase made over the internet and the first purchase to be protected by encrypted technology.\\nThat same year, a 30 year old Jeff Bezos quit his Wall Street job in hopes of starting an internet company, and Amazon.com was created. The company grew quickly, and in 1999, Time Magazine named Jeff Bezos “Person of the Year” for popularizing online shopping. Almost 25 years later, Amazon is the biggest online retailer in the US.\\nIn 1995, Pierre Omidyar founded the P2P retail site, ebay.com. The “auction”-style business model changed the way people shop at the turn of the century by allowing people to bid on items that spoke to them.\\nIn 2003, Apple introduced the iTunes store and by 2004, iTunes had sold 100 million songs. iTunes was revolutionary in that it aided in the acceptance and expansion of social sharing — people could now easily share and suggest their favorite music to friends over the internet.',\n",

It can be solved, but only through the intersection of new technologies and fresh approaches with status-quo establishments in the water sector. Easier said than done, but what a huge opportunity.\\nAll things considered, urban water management sits low on the “environmental urgency” totem pole. A dangerous combination of institutional risk-aversion,paltry investmentin new technology, andartificially low water pricesfactor into this lethargy. Meanwhile, urbanization, the decay of century old infrastructure, and unpredictable weather patterns are straining urban water systems to the brink of failure.\\nThe Key to Climate Resiliency: Innovation\\nIt used to be that we could rely on past data to determine groundwater supplies or the potential for flooding in a given area. Those days are long gone. A changing climate is a present reality that has everything to do with our future water security. In 2017, extreme weather cost the U.S.$300 billion.\\nNewscientific researchshows thatten timesmore Americans are at risk of being flooded out by rivers within the next 20 years, even if greenhouse emissions are completely and immediately curbed. If water security comes down to how cities address thisnew normal, old path-dependent approaches will prove disastrous.',\n",

       "  'article': 'As we welcome in 2019, we leave behind a year that has come with exceptional scientific breakthroughs that will leave a smile on our face well into this New Year.\\nAlthough the battle against Alzheimer still has a long way to go, with no effective cures on the market and no promising results yet for drugs designed to slow down the onset of the disease, researchers can at least now hope to detect the disease decades before its onset.\\nDr. Randall Bateman´s team at Washington University School of Medicine is developing a quick inexpensive amyloid beta blood test that can identify patients long before they start developing the symptoms. Identifying and treating patients sooner might help develop preventative measures.\\nAnother breakthrough test, developed at the University of Queensland, is a universal cancer test that can detect traces of any cancer in a blood sample in 10 minutes. The test is based on the discovery that cancer DNA sticks to metal surfaces in a different way to healthy DNA, which is much more heavily methylated. This translates into a colorimetric test in which gold nanoparticles interacting with the patient´s DNA will allow the detection of cancer DNA.\\nUnfortunately 2018 has also opened our eyes about the great problem the planet faces due to pollution with plastic. On the brighter side, many talented researchers are racing against the clock to solve the issue. And as an example, a new enzyme is being developed to break down PET, which could allow plastic bottles to be fully recycled back into new bottles, limiting the need to produce new plastic.',\n",

       "  'article': 'You Are Technical, And So Is Everyone Else\\nPart of why we founded DEFcon 201 is to combat misplaced notions surrounding Technology and a person being “Technical”. Every now and again, I will meet someone who describes themselves as a non-technical person. This is in fact not true. All people are in fact technical. Everything from flipping a lightswitch to driving a car is in fact a technical operation. Most people use cellphones, computers, the internet, automobiles. Even those that do not, used previous generations of machines like typewriters, faxes, phones, and bicycles. These are all machines with histories. Engineered constructions.\\nIts always been like this. The very concept of civilization is a society and social evolution around machines and engineering. All known human societies are in fact known to use construct and use tools. It is noted by the peoeple who study as such as a common defining element of humanity. To us there is nothing greater to be more in touch with the human spirit than to understand and have agency of the tools we use, and define our lives. Be it computers and phones, or even automobiles, trains, and radios.\\nSome people have noted that others do in fact seek and master a greater understanding of the engineering in their surroundings than others. There is a misplaced shroud of secrecy and mythos surrounding these seekers and the machines they operate. It is the mission of our group invite the public to gain a better understanding and knowledge of the machines already in their lives that they use and depend on. For gaining knowledge and capaiblities in such system is to give agency, we aruge that it be the right of all peoples and persons to be able to understand such technology around them, as well as pursue technology to enrich and better their own lives.\\nWe, at DC201 urge you to be more technical, to get in touch with the machines around you, you depend on, and with it. We are here to help.',\n",

If anyone recognises it please hit me up with a source so I can credit the original author.\\nWe’ve all probably heard in some way form or another that Social Media is ruining our mental health, and too often we need to be “available” for people and we need to“reply in good time”.\\nWhen focusing on a task or something at work this past year, it seemed easier than ever for me to switch off and get distracted and open up Facebook or Reddit for a quick browse. If a message pops up on Android as a heads-up notification it’s immediately there, and in your face. I’ve started swiping them up or away as they are just so intrusive. I guess now it’s time to just turn them off for good. If you want you can go to the extreme and just place your phone on silent for good, with perhaps the option of including exceptions for calls from the most important people in your life.\\nPhones are amazing devices but the way that they operate as well as all social media distraction sinkholes is to get and then keep your attention. That’s why I’veremoved suggested videos from YouTubeand muted most notifications on the few social apps installed. I’vekilled the Facebook news feedfrom pretty much every device I own and resorted to using Chrome on my phone if I want to see what’s on there.

       "  'article': 'Within science fiction, particularly the subgenre known as cyberpunk, humans augment themselves with various technological devices and prosthetics to enhance themselves beyond human capabilities, or to repair themselves in ways that perfectly replicate body functions. So how do modern prosthetics fare compared to the technological marvels of fiction? While we have made huge leaps forward in bionics andmyoelectrics, we are not quite yet at the level of the cyberpunk future. But with graphene, we may just be able to get there. The material’s strength, light weight, and endless utility could lead to even more dramatic advancements in prosthetic technology.\\nIn modern prosthetics,bionic limbshave done excellently in replicating movement and function of missing body parts for amputees, offering mostly full range of motion for legs, feet, arms, and hands. This can be contributed to the development of myoelectric sensors, which connect the artificial limb to the natural electrical processes generated by muscles in order to enable complex movement. Hand prosthetics in particular have made major advancements in replicating the intricate and specific motor functions of fingers.\\nOur advancements in prosthetics make it so that we can successfully regain lost function, but still lack meaningful tactile perception. While some might argue that the absence of pain is a benefit, the use of touch to perceive potentially harmful stimuli to the host would be a valuable addition to the features prosthetics provide, not to mention the emotional and psychological relief that may come with such upgrades to prosthetic tech.\\nThis is where graphene can step in. Scientists have begun to use the wonder material to create agraphene-based skinfor prosthetics. This e-dermis electrically stimulates the amputee’s nerves non-invasively through the skin, replicating the process of signal relaying that the brain utilizes in tactile feeling. In addition, graphene’s optical transparency allows for 98% of light to pass through it, making the perfect material toutilize solar energyto power these advanced prosthetics. Of course, pain is not the only feeling that this graphene skin would allow users to process, and it’s potential to make the feeling from phantom limbs a reality again is truly wondrous to behold.\\nEven more intricate, graphene can potentially be used to create smallimplantsand internal prostheses that would be capable of correcting eyesight or hearing, to repair the body and help in overcoming degenerative diseases, or even help mend broken bones. Previously, silicon-based implants were too damaging to internal tissues if disturbed, and the conditions inside the body damaged the electronic components. However, graphene’s strength, being 200 times stronger than steel, and its flexibility make it much more durable. It is also possible to use graphene to create transistors that are gated by the natural fluids surrounding the implant. With graphene, the hyper-advanced technological developments of cyberpunk are closer than ever.',\n",

Artificial intelligence, sensors, data-analytics, and blockchain (to name a few) are amplifying and accelerating each other. This will lead to new applications across all areas of the economy and society in 2019.\\nIn a digital age, any new approach to education needs to adopt a more “skills-based” focus that aims to build creativity. After all, we (and in particular the next generation) must be prepared to live and work more closely with intelligent, networked machines. The main focus of education shouldn’t be on the transfer of knowledge of standardized processes and procedures (these will certainly be automated) but on cultivating innovative and creative skills that cannot easily be replicated by machines.\\nIn a world of smart technologies, a premium will be put on the most human of qualities; our capacity for unique and highly personalized forms of self-expression. And all education needs to be re-organized around this goal.\\nI have written about this issue before, but I want to make it more concrete for 2019. Think about it as my New Year’s resolution.',\n",

       "  'article': 'By TOM WHITBY\\nIf there is one thing that I am sure of as an educator it is that rapid change greatly affects both what and how we learn. If there is a second thing that I am sure of as an educator it is that the evolution of technology is the driver of rapid change throughout our culture. Both of these factors in education and our culture lead me to question if teachers are being properly prepared to teach students whose learning is affected by so many different influences? The past learning experiences of educators are so different from the current and evolving experiences of their students that relevance as an educator is extremely important. Do today’s teachers understand the learning needs of today’s students?\\nA generational gap is a world of difference in terms of technology. For this reason I feel that many educators are products of a 20th century education that limits them as educators in the 21st century. Of course there are educators who have continually, professionally developed to stay relevant, but maybe not in enough numbers to make a great difference.\\nIn the 20th century information was for the most part slower to change and often controlled by a small group of power brokers. News came from newspapers and magazines that were limited to publishing cycles and editors. The media was dominated by three networks which were limited by news cycles and strict editorial boards. Censors were assigned to every entertainment show to regulate the perceived moral agenda. Encyclopedias took years to amend and edit with an additional year to physically publish and were limited in circulation by high costs to the general public. Most households had telephones, but not a private line for each household member. The challenges of rapid change were not yet in place even though the stage was being set.\\nThe Vietnam War began to awaken changes in the way we viewed the news. Journalists used more media tools in their reporting. Photos and film began to be broadcast in the news cycle, which was at a family-gathered dinnertime for most Americans. Students were moved by what they saw and many began to demonstrate against the government in numbers never before seen. These demonstrations then became media news as well, which exacerbated the anti-war movement. It took years of this to bring the war to an end, even with the help of the existing technology, which was controlled by forces heavily influenced by the government.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Social media is growing at a rapid rate. As more and more people find new ways to contribute to social media, it will continue to unfold. Social media is an open platform and highly integrable with any other program or algorithms which allows for even more expansion and flexibility to make it even better. With these above ideas in mind, let us explore how social media will change as we progress.\\n1. Customized platform:With the integration of A.I. into social media, your profile and your social media will get customized according to your habits, behaviors, and personal preferences. You will be able to book cabs, order food and check your feed all in one platform. To be more succinct, social media will be an all-in-one app or platform for your daily needs and tasks.\\n2. Richness in quality of posts:The quality of social media posts will be rich in content and variety. As of now, you can see high-quality photos on Instagram. This will transcend all platforms. On top of that, the new IGTV feature in Instagram is gaining a ton of traction which will eventually convert to a mini YouTube sort of thing (already happening). These examples suggest a pattern or hint towards what we can expect in the future.\\n3. Videos:The Internet is more accessible now than ever. Facebook recently announced that it would focus more on delivering videos to your news feed and suggested that videos were the future in social media. If you are a frequent user of Facebook, you may have already noticed this trend. Facebook is going to add more videos to your newsfeed.\\n4. Customizable:Social media platforms will adhere to your preferences, tastes, and needs. This means that you will be able to select the themes and layout, customize the tabs, and design the layout you want from a selection of combinations.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Over the past thirty years, central banks focused on fighting inflation globally and have been failing. Given that inflation has been identified as the major culprit in most of the global depression since the 1920’s to today, no wonder most financial institutions have made it their target trying to control and manage it. However, it was the financial crisis of 2008 that led to deeper questioning of economic processes, credit system and debt management.\\nThe recession pointed out a gap in the public’ trust in financial institutions and governments due to the lack of transparency and accountability in financial world. The question on everyone’s mind is: will this stop, or it will continue? Are there any solutions out there that can prevent the collapse of financial fundamentals that are built around a centralised system? Not a question with an easy or short answer, but the smart money seems to be on blockchain architecture that is using cutting edge technology to build trust and transparency.\\nBlockchain platform are attracting the attention of financial service sector to its innovative technology that is set to change the future and it has emerged as a new paradigm in the financial industry. In 2016, the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicted that blockchain will revolutionize financial services, and build a solid platform where consumers and producers / buyers and sellers will converge. The financial sector however, is apprehensive considering the technology’s link to cryptocurrencies and evolving blockchain technology use in other sectors.\\nIn 2017, the banking sector and remittance industry experienced industry disruptions and large-scale mergers. By the end of the year, a consensus between the banking sector and blockchain technologists were reached. In the first quarter of 2018 several banks started adopting and testing the technology in phases. Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) has created the “internet of value” by empowering peer to peer, transparent, immediate and almost free exchanges of value over the internet awakening the banking industry the real possibility of their demise and effectively killing the stranglehold they have on the financial markets, not a pretty thought if you are involved in the finance business.\\nAccording to Statistics, from 2016 to 2021 it is estimated that blockchain technology is heating the global market aggressively, with the Blockchain industry market reacing 339.5 Million USD in size and is forecast to grow to 2.3 billion USD by 2021. Although banks and financial institutions have always been at the frontline of the technology evolution, it is very interesting to know they are preparing for a true battle. Who will win? Who will emerge triumphant and reap the spoils of war?',\n",

It has created a platform and foundation that will allow all types of companies to share their creative work and get recognized globally. Therefore, we have compiled 10 reasons to help you understand how social media can effectively grow your business and get you new customers.\\n1. Brand Awareness— When you post on Facebook about the brand, almost anyone in the world can view it and engage with your post. This opens the gateway to so many opportunities and prospective customers.\\n2. Increase in Sales— This is the most sought-after consequence for business owners after they make their brand presence known on social media. New prospective customers in and around the local area get to know about your brand and will choose to try out your brand. If it is e-commerce, then you will have a lot of requests for shipping from abroad or local areas. It will depend on your brand category or your industry. However, it will surely contribute to more sales.\\n3. Better Understanding of the marketplace— Once your brand gets recognized on social media, you will start to understand the marketplace better. You will get more awareness about your competitors, the current trends as well as the general overview of the demand and supply of the products/services. This will assist you in refining your product/service and empower you to sell better and create an overall pleasant experience.\\n4. New ideas— By interacting with customers online and getting valuable insights from data, you will be able to get new ideas for your current product/service or maybe even about a whole new different product. Ideas come from a variety of new experiences and that’s exactly what the social media promises.',\n",

       "  'article': 'For anyone, the idea of being able to make more money and secure your financial stability is appealing. People are constantly looking for side hustles to earn more money and ways to save the money they’ve already made. In the last few years, online banks and savings accounts have risen in popularity and offer a fantastic solution to traditional banking. While many people are wary of using asolely online bankand trusting their money to that entity, with research, you can find a great bank that provides better benefits than those of a brick-and-mortar financial institution.\\nBetter interest\\nFor most people, the greatest appeal of an online bank is that you’ll have a much greater interest rate for your savings account. Since an online bank does not have to worry about the cost of maintaining physical bank locations and hiring hundreds of employees, they’re able to offer a greater interest rate for your money, some as high as 2.0%. This number is incredibly appealing when compared to the average interest rate at a traditional bank, which is around 0.04%. Many people opt to continue to use a traditional bank for their checking account, but put their savings in an online account.\\nEqual security\\nMany are under the false assumption that online banks are simply not safe. However, online banks and traditional banks both have about the same amount of online security risks, since even traditional banks offer online banking. In order to make sure your money isas safe as possible, double check that the online bank you’re considering working with is FDIC insured and take security measures such as only accessing your account from secure WiFi and regularly changing your password.',\n",

       "  'article': 'La Navidad ya se divisa en el horizonte y las grandes ciudades europeas se preparan para acoger las tradicionales -y multitudinarias- celebraciones que acompañan a tan entrañables fechas. Por desgracia, distintos factores han motivado que la seguridad haya escalado posiciones en la planificación de cualquier evento navideño. Londres ha ido un paso más allá y ha diseñado un ambicioso programa de reconocimiento facial para identificar a cualquier posible sospechoso que se adentre en el centro de la ciudad. ¿Una medida necesaria o excesiva? El debate está servido.\\nLa Policía londinense desarrollará durante la Navidad una campaña de reconocimiento facial que tendrá dos líneas de actuación. En primer lugar, se creará un amplio fichero con los rostros de aquellos transeúntes que deseen participar en el programa. Para ello, agentes policiales debidamente identificados solicitarán a los ciudadanos que se dejen escanear el rostro. De este modo, los británicos contribuirán a agilizar el trabajo de la Policía a la hora de controlar grandes masas de personas. La segunda parte de la campaña consistirá en la instalación de cámaras de vídeo con la tecnología de reconocimiento facial integrada.\\nHasta aquí, las ventajas de la campaña son evidentes. Los agentes de Policía que están trabajando desde los diferentes centros de control pueden seguir en tiempo real la situación de las calles londinenses y, cuando aparezca un sospechoso, el sistema de reconocimiento facial activará la alarma pertinente. Conviene recordar que Reino Unido ha sufrido varios atentados terroristas de carácter islamista en los últimos años, al tiempo que el inminenteBrexitha generado una mayor sensación de inseguridad entre buena parte de la población. Con todo, tan invasivo protocolo de vigilancia no ha gustado a todos.\\nLa organización Big Brother Watch ha calificado el nuevo operativo policial londinense como “autoritario, peligroso e ilegal”. Autoritario porque supone ceder a las autoridades la potestad de reconocernos en cualquier situación y sin que medie una orden judicial (en principio, de manera voluntaria). Peligroso porque una cesión de ese calibre puede volverse en nuestra contra si alguien lograhackearel sistema de vigilancia. Ilegal porque, salvo que se modifique la legislación vigente (y no está previsto un movimiento en este sentido, no es lícito grabar a los transeúntes de manera indiscriminada. Por ahora, los policías de Londres sortean este último obstáculo con la petición formal a los ciudadanos para que colaboren con el operativo.\\nLa seguridad es una de nuestras grandes preocupaciones y en este espacio te comentaremos qué papel puede jugar la tecnología.',\n",

       "  'article': 'www.suppliertynews.com\\nWe are currently undergoing a major transition in the STEM field of genomic research. While some people may look at the word genomes and immediately think genetics there is a difference. According to WHO, “The main difference between genomics and genetics is that genetics scrutinizes the functioning and composition of the single gene where as genomics addresses all genes and their inter relationships in order to identify their combined influence on the growth and development of the organism.”\\nIdentifying their combined influence is key in today’s scientific market. What doctors around the world are now learning pertains to the importance of ethnic diversity in clinical trial research. “Human genomic databases — collections of all the genetic information that has been sequenced over the years — are” heavily skewed to people of European descent, making it harder to correctly diagnose medical issues for non-Europeans.\\nAccording to Scientific American, “The community has learned that there are far more of these larger, so-called structural variations than expected. These are now known to cause genetic disease and impact the way drugs are metabolized by individuals and ethnic populations.”\\nDue to this revelation, there is now a push to include more minorities in clinical trials. The necessity of this is at an all time high as. An example of specific medical issues effecting a specific ethnic group can be seen in the Korean genome project which “found a population-specific variant in a gene that regulates how some medications are metabolized by the body; this is essential information for dosing and for gauging the likelihood that a patient will respond to a particular therapy.”',\n",

The inside of Target if we’re being honest.\\nBut what else? More than likely, they see a lot of your phone. It’s always handy, and I get it. You want it right on hand to be able to snap the best pictures at the most opportune times. That’s the beauty of the cameras on phones. It’s convenient and you just never know when you might see the perfect picture.\\nBut then they start to associate seeing you with seeing a phone. Where are we going to go from here? I challenge you to think about how much you’re holding onto your phone, how much your child looks at you and sees your phone, how much the phone is in front of their face instead of your face being in front of them.\\nHow many “perfect pictures” do you need of them anyway? What are you going to do with all of them? Maybe post them on Facebook, on Instagram, your VSCO if you have that type of thing. Someday you might get around to printing them, only to realize they’ve grown up so much and don’t look the same anymore so you only have one of the pictures up and then shove the rest in an envelope in a drawer. What does that mean for the rest of the thousands, yes thousands, of pictures we have?\\nI try to leave my phone places. In the room, by the couch. I make it a point not to bring it when we go places. It scares me when I think about the fact my child could get to a point where he is more excited to see my phone than my face because it might mean I’ll be interacting with him to get a smile for a picture. All he wants is the interaction and that’s what he’ll get with the phone.',\n",

It’s the last day, ever, that we can use a metropass on the Toronto Transit system. From January 1 2019, the Presto electronic payment system takes over, and that means that our ability to travel by bus or subway through the city untracked has radically decreased. We could buy a metropass with cash, use it every day all month by showing it to a fare collector, and no record that connected us with that card would be created. Not so with Presto.\\nPresto, now in operation in Greater Toronto, Hamilton and Ottawa transit systems, is developing a reputation as the system we love to hate. But the gripes you hear floating around about the switch from pass to Presto are focused on the fact that the Presto system is plagued with dysfunctional card readers, auto-fill errors that leave riders unexpectedly out of funds, and vending machines that are better at taking money than spitting out new cards. These are all irritating, but they’re likely to get fixed over time.\\nThe big issue that we’re not talking much about at all is privacy — when Presto becomes the only option, anonymous travel becomes pretty much impossible.

       "  'article': 'More than a thousand days after the water problems in Flint, Michigan, became national news, thousands of homes in the city still have lead pipes, from which the toxic metal can leach into the water supply. To remedy the problem, the lead pipes need to be replaced with safer, copper ones. That sounds straightforward, but it is a challenge to figure out which homes have lead pipes in the first place. The City’s records are incomplete and inaccurate. And digging up all the pipes would be costly and time-consuming.\\nThat’s just the kind of problem that automation is supposed to help solve. So volunteer computer scientists, with some funding from Google,designed a machine-learning modelto help predict which homes were likely to have lead pipes. The artificial intelligence was supposed to help the City dig only where pipes were likely to need replacement. Through 2017, the plan was working. Workers inspected 8,833 homes, and of those, 6,228 homes had their pipes replaced — a 70 percent rate of accuracy. Heading into 2018, the City signed a big, national engineering firm,AECOM, to a $5 million contract to “accelerate” the program, holding a buoyant…',\n",

Let’s take a look at some of the most in-demand IT jobs of 2019–2020.\\nThis is one of the best tech jobs in 2019 because the demand for computer vision engineers has grown at a steady rate over the past five years. Their primary responsibilities include creating and fine-tuning both computer vision and ML algorithms so that they can locate, identify and classify objects. Also, since AR/VR has also grown in popularity and is expected to be a $215 billion-dollar business by 2021, the need for computer vision engineer will also increase because it is directly on Ted with AR and VR.\\n2. ML Engineer\\nThe ML (Machine Learning) engineers create AI systems and machines that are capable of learning and applying what they learned. They conduct advanced programming while working with convoluted datasets and algorithms to train their AI creations.

Oh! Good to see you.”\\nSpiegel has got better at dealing with these encounters. Though he described himself this year as shy, the 28-year-old stands out today with his sharp dark suit, white open-collar shirt and certain kind of LA sheen. He immediately introduces me, as if the guy would care at all who I am, and asks what he is up to.\\nSpiegel may not be quite as famous as Mark Zuckerberg — nobody has so far made a semi-fictionalised movie about him — or the founders of Google. But as America’s youngest billionaire and co-founder of Snapchat, the picture-messaging app used by 186m people every day, this is the kind of thing that tends to happen when you’re hanging around in a chicken-and-chips joint.\\nDuring the course of 2018, Wall Street has fallen out of love with Spiegel. Shares in Snapchat’s parent company Snap are ending the year almost 75 per cent below their peak in February. But the paradox of…',\n",

       "  'article': 'Factordaily did a story about how Wechat failed in India. It’s quite well written & parts of the story are contributed by my friend & former colleagueHimanshu Gupta. If you haven’t read it, you can check it out here —https://factordaily.com/how-wechat-faded-into-the-silence-in-india/. As someone who’s followed the evolution of chat apps & used most of them extensively, i thought i’ll offer my thoughts on the subject.\\nA key argument in the blog is that Wechat failed to localize it’s product for the Indian market. In my view while localization plays a part in success of a platform, the bigger ideology behind the product & deeper market conditions usually lead to the success or failure of a particular product. Here by localization i mean adding/removing/modifying features or translating app text/content(Example local music in Tik-tok) or changing notation/icons(clap instead of like) not re-thinking the product for the native market & designing from ground up met to their needs specifically.\\nWhen launching a new product in an existing market, the most important factor is differentiation. One simply can’t compete with the same features for the same set of users. There are 2 approaches to launching a product — launch on a smaller scale, understand the key needs & iterate(something Newsdog is also doing with multiple apps) or (if $$$ permitting) do a big bang launch to generate curiosity among your users & try to make users jump ship.\\nWechat when they launched in India focused on Voice notes — a feature used in China to a great extent to differentiate & the social aspect of the app.\\nThe TV campaign got them a initial set of users but maybe in the end the users didn’t use the features highlighted. The set of users who used the app was still English speakers who preferred text messaging to voice notes.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Yesterday, trading of Apple’s stock was briefly paused for CEO Tim Cook to deliver some bad, but not wholly unexpected, news: revenue in Q1 2019 would fall far short of expectations, in large part due to slow iPhone sales. Reports have been coming out for a couple of months suggesting that Apple’s new slate of iPhones — XR, XS, and XS Max — were not selling as much as the company had expected, and now that’s been confirmed.\\nWhen Apple reported its Q4 2018 numbers, it provided Q1 2019 guidance of $89 billion to $93 billion in revenue and a gross margin between 38 to 38.5 percent. Cook now says Q1 revenue will be closer to $84 billion — $5 billion below even its low-end target — and gross margin will come in at around 38 percent. But why is revenue, in particular, so much lower than expected?\\nIn Cook’sletter to investors, he singles out China as the main “challenge” the company faced in meeting its revenue targets, in particular the lower-than-expected iPhone sales in the region — but problems with the iPhone line go beyond Greater China. Apple has placed far too much attention on its share price in recent years, and now theissues with Apple’s product lineare coming back to bite it.\\nAny slowdown in the iPhone line is a huge problem for Apple because it alone accounted fornearly 63 percent of the company’s revenuein fiscal year 2018. When the iPhone falters, Apple falters — which makes all the stock buybacks and dividend increases Cook has spent the past several years pursuing to please investors useless.\\nIn explaining the lower iPhone revenues, Cook blames lower carrier subsidies, a stronger US dollar, and cheaper battery replacements — the latter of which he positioned as a benevolent move by the company inan interview with CNBCwhen it was actually a response toa massive scandalover slowing down batteries in older iPhones.',\n",

That’s the idea behind theStereoPi— a carrier board, which can also be used for computer vision, drone, and robot projects. The open source board is compatible with all Compute Modules (1, 3,3+) and runs Raspbian right out of the box.\\nThe StereoPi boasts a pair of CSI camera ports (supporting OV5647 and Sony IMX 219 cameras), micro USB port, micro SD card slot, a couple of USB ports, 1X USB header, HDMI, Ethernet, SO-DIMM connector, 5V power connector, on/off power switch, boot mode jumper, and a 40-pin GPIO header — all packed into a 90 x 40mm footprint.\\nThe StereoPi is versatile and has already been employed in some real world applications — such as pairing it with anOculus Riftto render people in a third-person view, using it withROSfor simple depth-mapping, andstitching360-degree panoramic images. Of course, the StereoPi can be used for a myriad of other applications, like building computer vision systems with OpenCV, live streaming video directly to YouTube from drone and robotic platforms, and even creating your own augmented and virtual reality systems.\\nBeyond Raspbian and ROS, the board can be programmed using Python, C, and C++, depending on the project. The StereoPi isn’t yet available, however a batch of them have entered pre-production and have been thoroughly tested, which means they will go on to post-production shortly and will soon appear onCrowd Supply.\\nUPDATE:StereoPi’s campaign has now launched on Crowd Supply, starting at $69 for the ‘slim edition’ and $89 for the ‘standard’ board. Starter and deluxe kits are also available for $125 and $199, respectively.',\n",

       "  'article': 'By Mark Gurman\\nApple Inc.’s Tim Cook confirmed Wednesday that the latest iPhones, his flagship product, are not selling up to expectations. The news exposes his toughest challenge sincetaking overas chief executive officer from the legendary Steve Jobs: how to take the company forward when its top product has lost luster with consumers.\\nCook has dealt with a series of controversies during his more than seven years in the role, ranging from the company’s failed Google Maps replacement launch and the need tooustthe head of iPhone software in 2012, to concerns over labor andtax practices. He has calmly navigated the politics of President Donald Trump’s administration, and so far has avoided tariffs on the company’s key devices as the U.S.-China trade war widens.\\nNow comes the disclosure in aletterto investors that Apple sold fewer than anticipated new iPhones, and would cut its holiday quarter sales outlook byas much as $9 billion. Cook plans to address Apple staff about the situation on Thursday at an all-hands meeting where he will take questions from workers, according to a person familiar with the matter.\\n“This is probably one of the hardest things Tim Cook has had to do as CEO, putting out that letter today,” said Michael Gartenberg, a former Apple…',\n",

       "  'article': '“Turn off media, turn on life”, urges the promotional video from South Korea’s Nori Media Education Centre for the Prevention of Internet Addiction, an organisation funded by a mixture of private and public money. Its manager, Kwon Jang-hee, is passionate about protecting children from the ill effects of the internet, and above all of smartphones, which he considers most damaging of all because of their omnipresence. Parents do not understand how dangerous the internet is, he says, pointing to a study by Seoul National University that detected similarities between the brain activity of cocaine addicts and computer-games enthusiasts. If he had his way, youngsters would have to wait for their smartphones until they had graduated from high school.\\nIn one of the world’s most highly connected societies there is little chance that he will get his wish, but plenty of South Korean parents agree that their children are overdosing on screens. A recent government survey on smartphone and internet addiction put the share of three- to nine-year-olds at high risk of addiction at 1.2% and that of teenagers at 3.5%. That may not seem a lot, but when it happens the effects can be devastating. Some of these children are on their phones for at least eight hours a day and lose interest…',\n",

These breaches, which have degraded consumer trust and led to increased government scrutiny, are the result of inadequate data protection and insufficient restrictions around data sharing and use.\\nAs the value of data rises, it will become increasingly important to strike a balance between using data and protecting privacy. Failure to do so results in data silos, which greatly diminish the value of data for innovation and societal benefit. Emerging privacy-preserving technology can help provide a win-win solution, offering unprecedented user privacy protections while enabling new applications for data.\\nBlockchain provides transparency but not privacy: on current blockchain platforms, transactions and data are publicly visible. Privacy-preserving techniques combined with blockchain can enable new decentralized applications that protect data while providing users with transparency and control over how data is used. Theseprivacy-first applicationswill help restore consumer trust, creating a virtuous cycle that fosters development of data-driven applications.\\nWe think 2019 will see a dramatic shift to privacy-first applications, catalyzed by three growing trends that reinforce each other: an increased user demand to control their own privacy, the rollout of new privacy regulations, and advancements in privacy-preserving technologies.',\n",

The Plus offers double the power (10-watts) over the original and features an assortment of attachments that can be utilized for any number of projects.\\nThe Solderdoodle is outfitted with a high-efficiency, high-power charge controller and uses similar lithium-ion rechargeable batteries found in Tesla electric vehicles. With that said, the hot multi-tool has an hour of work time at maximum power (5000 C) before needing a recharge; however Isaac states that regular soldering sessions only last a few minutes long, so under regular use, the battery can last weeks on a single charge.\\nConsidering that the Solderdoodle is portable and charges over USB, you can tap into just about any mobile device power source if need be — portable rechargers, laptops, or even solar chargers if they happen to be available.\\nAs far as features go, the Solderdoodle is outfitted with a touch sensor that allows you to ‘swipe’ to different power levels, which is denoted on an LED power-level indicator. A switch on the back of the tool enables you to turn the tool on or off, and includes a safety mechanism that puts it in sleep mode when not in use. It is also compatible with a myriad of different tips — chisel, conical, wood burning, needle, spade, and blade, among others.\\nPorras is currently crowdfunding the Solderdoodleon Kickstarterwith pledges starting at $99 for the tool and tip package; but, you can get just the tip package for $41 if you prefer your own soldering iron or wood burning tool.',\n",

In an effort to capture this magic our office sat down, shaking off the glow of holiday gluttony and that “one” drink on New Years, to reflect on the top moments of 2018 that deeply inspired us. Naturally, we looked inward to our very own values as the guide to our thoughts. We must admit in doing this we all had a “holy shit” moment when we realized what a prolific year it has been for us all.\\nHere is our official 2018 review inspired by our values:\\nWe embrace all forms of diversity from ethnicity to experience. The process of building harmony can be messy but the results are powerful and more than worth it.\\n1.)Hollywood woke TFU to the fact that movie goers are craving stories that reflect global culture and represent difference in an authentic and somewhat epic way.Groundbreaking movies like Black Panther, Crazy Rich Asians and Oceans 8, which earned $700m, $250m and $300m at the box office respectively have finally proven that minority casts and women can deliver blockbuster returns in their own right.\\n2.) 2018 was the year of women in action.From #MeToo mobilizing deeper impact in every industry to Oprah’s speech at the Golden Globes to the female takeover of the Midterm elections to women driving in Saudi Arabia to the Royal Wedding of Megan and Harry we watched first after first that changed history.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and Pohang University of Science and Technology have introduced a machine learning algorithm system, InstaGAN, which can perform multiple instance-aware image-to-image translation tasks — such as replacing sheep in photos with giraffes — on multiple image datasets. The paperInstaGAN: Instance-Aware Image-to-Image Translationhas been accepted by the respected International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2019, which will take place this May in New Orleans, USA.\\nAn image-to-image translation system is a system that learns to map an input image onto an output image. Unsupervised image-to-image translation has garnered considerable research attention recently in part due to the rapid development of generative adversarial networks (GANs) that now power the technique. Previous methods were not suitable for challenging tasks, for example if the image has multiple target instances or if the translation task involves challenging shapes. Last month Google AI researchers introduced a state-of-the-art model capable of realistically inserting an input object in a photo with both a reasonable position choice and an accurate prediction of the output object’s size, pose, shape, etc. The team behind InstaGAN, however, believed even this advanced method could be improved upon.\\nThis new research is based on CycleGAN, a GAN variant which can learn to translate images without paired training data to overcome the limitations of one-by-one pairing of pix2pix in image translation. CycleGAN can automatically translate two given unordered image sets X and Y, but it cannot encode instance information in an image. CycleGAN results however are not ideal when translating images involving specific features of the target. The InstaGAN system overcomes this problem and combines instance information from multiple task targets.\\nInstaGAN combines the boundaries of the target while ignoring details such as colour. Compared to CycleGAN for image-to-image translation, InstaGAN is more successful in generating a reasonable shape for the targeted instance while preserving its original context.\\nThe research has been accepted as an ICLR 2019 Poster Paper. Reviewers indicated the method was novel and solved information problems not solved by previous methods with a clear explanation; that results looked significantly better than CycleGAN and other baselines; and called for additional controlled experiments with the model.',\n",

In late 2018, the company announced plans to base one of its two new “headquarters” in Long Island City, Queens.\\nAmazon’s leaders probably assumed that the decision would delight locals. After all, New York mayor Bill de Blasio was so keen to lure the company that he joined forces with his arch-rival Andrew Cuomo, New York governor, to offer incentives.\\nBut local residents have not reacted as the city elites — or Amazon officials — might have expected. Instead of welcoming the new high-paying jobs, some locals organised community meetings to try to keep Amazon out.\\nAs Tania Mattos, a leader at Queens Neighborhoods United, a group that \\xadpromotes affordable housing in the area, \\xadtold the FT: “This deal was not for our communities and, if it’s not for our communities, we’re not going to allow them into our neighbourhood.”',\n",

       "  'article': 'At the beginning of last year I wrote “Trends from 2017, Predictions for 2018”This year I wanted to focus on spaces and problems I’m thinking about. If you have a company addressing any of these topics or are an investor looking at these spaces please be in touch. Of course, all comments and thoughts are welcome.\\nTech is global—\\u200athis was and continues to be true. Tech has become so significant that it now blends with national interests to such an extent that even autocrats are wary of tech companies. I’d heard a rumor that Jack Ma was forced to step down from Alibaba because he met with Trump before Xi Jinping. Whether that’s true or not it’s a sign of the times. Battles for dominance are playing out between nation states and it seems to be a two horse race between China and the US. Russia, North Korea and others have hacked many US institutions and attempted to interfere with elections. Softbank wascaught up in the Saudi MBS scandal. The EUhas been a tough regulatoron US tech companies but Europe itself isn’t competitive in technology\\u200a—\\u200aputting it at a significant disadvantage long term.\\nI’ve been thinking about community a lotand how technology can really improve day to day life. What makes a great town or city? One important element is safety and security. In 2018 I experienced bike theft, package theft and identity theft. Technology like Nextdoor, Nest, Ring,Bike Index, are helpful for consumers. More controversial is the idea of asocial credit score in China. In the US, the police are over worked and prisons are over crowded. I’m open to local government using cameras and AI to stop crime (and actually deter it). If people are smashing up scooters, breaking into homes, spray painting schools, orbreaking car windowsI don’t have a lot of sympathy for them\\u200a—\\u200acameras plus AI can help record, identify and catch these folks. Police should have access to world class technology tools and perhaps they’d be less prone to using force.\\nHumans Are Underrated— I don’t see humans being replaced by robots or AI any time soon. Humans are super smart at general intelligence and their bodies are superior to any general purpose robot. But robots and AI combined with human intelligence in manufacturing or almost any other context are powerful. This is something Elon Muskwas reminded of the hard way. AI+ humans can create interesting things. What if skilled laborers working on a construction project were orchestrated, scheduled and even inspected by AI and they got to keep more of the economics (which goes to the construction management companies now)? There is currently ashortage of skilled laborin the US so look for humans to be augmented and not replaced in the short and medium term. AI can make it so humans can do more advanced work and AI can also be useful in training for new skill sets.\\nHomelessness and drug addiction are getting worse—\\u200athis is straight out of dystopian science fiction. For some, drugs can be recreational or even enlightening but for a certain percentage of people they result in devastating addiction. Opioid derivativeshave gotten crazy.New ideas for how to deal with drugs like legalization are being explored in various States which is a worthy endeavor. Homelessness (largly the result of substance abuse, mental illness and a housing crunch) is a hard problem which has plagued anddivided San Francisco. There are some interesting new companies likeWeRecover,Two Chairs, andPear Therapeuticsproviding therapy online. AI could eventually be used to provide or augment therapy in the not too distant future. Building restrictions have become onerous and the construction industry is ripe for innovation.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Can you imagine a world where a tattoo on your body can track your blood sugar and heart rate? Seems a bit like an episode of Black Mirror, but according to recent tech innovations, that reality soon might not be far off. From tattooed biosensors to robot caretakers anddigital pill dispensers, there are innumerable ways that tech can transform the healthcare space.\\nHowever, before we explore the ways that tech can both assist and improve healthcare, we first need to examine the current and ongoing healthcare crisis, both globally and right here in America. Sadly, the problems that started over 50 years ago are still plaguing the global healthcare system today.\\nGlobally, the healthcare industry is constantly facing challenges. Did you know that one in seven people on the planet is on-the-move? That statistic equates to abouta billionmigrating people — astaggeringnumber and the most there has ever been throughout the course of history. In particular, refugees and other migrants face distinct obstacles in accessing health care, including language barriers, cultural differences, unfamiliarity with local health services, and the inability to readily access quality healthcare. Their diverse needs also present difficulty; from migrant farmworkers who have been exposed to toxic chemicals to refugees dealing with the trauma of war. The global health implications of the healthcare crisis are ever-present in today’s world.\\nAdditionally, the cost of healthcare both in America and worldwide has been an on-and-off concern for years. According to a recent Wall Street Journal article,health care costsin the U.S. are predicted to reach 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025. What the report failed to note was that America is now in our 50th year of the official US health care crisis — yikes!\\nConsider this: in 1960, healthcare expenditures were$27.2 billion, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. In 2010, U.S. taxpayers paid nearly $2.6 trillion forhealthcare services. This statistic means that in two generations, the burden on U.S. taxpayers has increased almost hundredfold. So, what’s the solution to this massive healthcare problem that has plagued the U.S. for five decades? You guessed it: tech is now a major player that has just come into the healthcare space and may change the course of history.',\n",

With this thought, I, along with every member atTeam Koinex, extend the warmest wishes for 2019. I would also personally like to take a moment to thank all our users, backers and believers who stood by us throughout 2018 and because of whose blessings we are where we stand today.\\nSince the beginning of 2018, the digital assets and cryptocurrency market has witnessed a bumpy ride. Falling prices, fewer ICOs, unfavourable regulations and many more factors have kept the true potential of blockchain technology, decentralisation and a tokenised global economy from blossoming.\\nFor India in particular, things became worse with the introduction of the Reserve Bank of India’s directive to isolate formal banking services from the entire blockchain-based digital assets industry. This was harsh, to say the least, as a few significant exchanges shut shop in India. A bearish market, unavailability of formal banking services, lack of initiatives and finally the complete absence of regulatory clarity dealt a crippling blow to an otherwise booming technology sphere.\\nNevertheless, atKoinex, we choose to always look at the positive side. Everyone here is focused on solutions, not the problems. We kept our innovation going and we did our best to keep the industry alive and kicking. We created India’s most loved peer-to-peer trustful token transaction network —Loop.We also introduced a peer-to-peer INR deposit/withdrawal mechanism. We added 32 coins, 72 trading pairs across 4 markets. In addition to this, we introduced India’s first crypto gifting service and conducted numerous trading contests and competitions, giving away prizes over INR 1 crore. Along with these user-focused developments, our Engineering team worked hard on a lot of behind-the-scenes components to enhance the performance of the exchange: we built a world-class trade engine which could handle a million transactions per second. We also developed a real-time messaging service,Pushman, which filled the ticker and orderbooks with data, broadcasting millions of messages every hour. On top of the development, we continuously kept improving the security on the platform, which has always been our priority.\\nOn top of all the things that we did in 2018, we laid out the foundation for our mission — making India a hotbed of blockchain technology development. We hosted our first#KoffeeWithKoinexmeetup in Mumbai in December 2018 which received a tremendous response; that was enough for us to gear up and plan to hold regular meetups in every part of the country in 2019. We partnered with another blockchain company in Bengaluru and co-hosted a developer-centric hands-on workshop on EOS blockchain in November 2018. We plan to organise many more hackathons and developer conferences throughout 2019. All of these only serve as a small step and contribution in building the entire blockchain ecosystem in India!',\n",

       "  'article': 'Yesterday, Tim Cook released a letter to Apple’s investor explaining what many already knew that iPhone sales are slowing around the world and in turn, it’ll reduce the revenue for Apple’s fiscal 2019 first quarter.\\nTim Cook’s letter.\\nWhat led to this?There are a variety of reasons to be factored but, I think that Apple overplayed its hand in raising the prices of iPhone to the extent that even loyal Apple fan like me hated. The smartphone market has begun to saturate and, the room for growth is steadily declining. Apple knew this already and, in 2017 they increased the price of iPhone touching 1000 dollars to combat the decline in the sale of iPhone. Apple got away with this cause the iPhone X brought loads of features compared to its previous model and, people didn’t care much to pay 1000 dollars to get the unique iPhone in their hand.\\nApple should have been confident then to increase the prices of iPhone last year to meet the slowdown in sales but, it backfired mainly cause the latest model looked same as previous models. Apple should have brought some compelling features to justify the price hike other than new color and bigger size but, the things didn’t turn out the way Apple had hoped. Even the budget iPhone XR was turned away by the people which led to never before marketing and trade in programs seen by the Apple. There are other problems too contributing to lackluster sales of iPhone but, the price is what that disappointed even the most loyal fans.\\nOf course, Tim Cook didn’t mention this in his letter to the investors. He cited China and its economy as a prime problem. Yes, China has been Apple’s headache for years mainly cause of the decline in the economy and the trade wars which may very well increase the iPhone prices again all over. China is Apple’s second largest market after the U.S and, the things are not looking well as Trump threatens to increase the tax price of products coming out of China to the U.S including iPhone. Apple soon needs to reduce its dependence on China and needs to look other emerging smartphone markets like India for manufacturing and increasing sales.',\n",

       "  'article': 'FromAlibaba DAMO Academy\\nMachine intelligence has already been generating great impacts on our life while we are still used to the era shaped largely by information revolution and mobile internet. Advanced technologies, functioning like “magics”, are developed based on rules and trends spotted by human beings. Today, Alibaba DAMO Academy published The Top 10 Technology Trends in 2019. We hope that by grasping the pace of revolution of technologies, we can make better use of these “magics” and be in charge of our own future.\\nDynamic and real-time urban infrastructure data, such as traffic, water, electricity and air quality data will be analyzed by large-scale computing platforms. The development of computing power and algorithms will foster the merge of nonstructural information such as video footages with structural information, making real-time modeling of urban simulation possible and holistic, intelligent decisions can be made. More resources will be allocated to technologies powering an intelligent “city brain” and its applications, while a city simulation model reflecting the real-time impulses and movements of a physical city can be built to facilitate the optimization of city governance. More cities in China are expected to have a “city brain” in 2019.\\nWith cloud-based speech interaction modules become standardized and affordable, people can “talk” to more and more public facilities as voice becomes an increasingly important interface. In the future, there will be at least one available interface point in our surroundings for voice interactions. As speech intelligence technology advances, real-time text-to-speech on mobile devices would be almost identical to human speech, even passing the Turing test in certain conversations, such as ones using a robotic voice to alert about delivery status. Rules and regulations need to be established to regulate the industry, to avoid misusing the technology in advertisements, harassing phone calls and fraud.\\nFor AI training in data centers, data movement between computing and memory has become a significant bottleneck. As a result, in addressing the challenge, memory-centric AI chip architecture based on the latest-generation of 3D-stacked memory technology will become mainstream. The demand for data bandwidth in AI chips will further motivate the use of 3D stacked memory, such as HBM (high-bandwidth memory) in AI training chips. In addition, brain-inspired neuromorphic computing chips will gain momentum, while researchers seek killer applications. Specialized AI chips may challenge the dominant position of GPUs for AI training in data centers. AI chips with architecture that truly reflect domain-specific features are expected to be increasingly used in edge computing.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Even in such a broad area like the humanities, a certainty seems to float around the life and work of any graduate of such arts: anything to do with the likes of Chaucer and Wilde has hardly anything in common with code and algorithms. That is to say, tech? Not on my critical analysis of late 14th century poems. This notion has been taken for granted for a very long time, becausestudents and professionals hardly found themselves studying on both sides of the academic pond, dabbling in both ancient writings and less ancient coding.\\nLuckily enough, the times are a-changing. A more diverse environment in tech is slowly emerging, and this does not refer solely to more gender mix and more skin colors. Thanks to the availability of tools for the strong-willed, programming is now more accessible to people with the most variegated backgrounds. Not having a traditional technical education can now also be an advantage in new ways. To get your hands on your code editor after your head has travelled to exotic mind-lands — those of art, and literature, and linguistics — can make you approach this field with completely different eyes than your desk neighbor, because you have seen so many, and so disparate, things. And it’s there that you can accomplish the coolest feat of all: manage to see even further, build on your previous experience to discover new conceptual territories.\\nThese lands might be unruly and wild, difficult to explore, but they are also home to incommensurable treasures. The name alone suggests an opposition: the humanities, study area that represents all that is inherently art in the world, have now acquired a companion term that represents the future:digital. Using the digits. Critical analysis of literary texts can now be aided by powerful software tools that can read and synthesize books in mere seconds; we are talking amounts of books you could not read in decades. Investigative stylometry can help a great deal with authorship problems, like when the Computational Stylistic Group found that acclaimed Italian writer Elena Ferrante not only is not who she says she is —it has probably been her husband all along. Now-forgotten citiesbecome alive from mere mapsof times long gone.The miracle of word, paper, and brain on fire is given yet extra superpowers bydigits. Numbers and words, binary and vocabulary, forever united. Or is it the case?\\nItcouldbe the case. Upon exploration of this young field, however, it seems like there is a hangup. And what could it be the hangup for such a happy party? Why, the guests, of course.\\nOk but what are the Digital Humanities and why do I keep capitalizing it (them)?! It’s 2018, Google it. Actually, just check outthis link. It is a page that once refreshed shows a different definition. This is how uncertain these waters are. Here is my favorite, by Paul Youngman:',\n",

       "  'article': '2019 is now here, but before leaving 2018 behind let’s recap a bit. It hasn’t been the easiest year for crypto — markets tumbled, sentiment slowed down, regulations tightened and the exuberance that characterized the market at the end of last year gradually transformed into a state of skepticism and reevaluation. A tough but necessary process, which is typical for every market cycle and amplified in crypto. We are going through a paradigm shift that is preparing the industry for healthier growth and more logical and structured valuation systems.\\nIn 2018 we have laid down the foundation for the days ahead. We released the early version of the APEX mobile wallet with multi-currency functionality, and at the end of November we released Phase One of the APEX Blockchain Testnet, all of which is according to our short and long-term technology development plan. Equally important is our expansion of the team and talent, which has surpassed even our own expectations and has outgrown the Microsoft offices into our own 200+ employee office. Lastly, we were through numerous awards recognized by a large number of organizations including Red Herring for our technological innovations, current success, robustness and future potential.We leave a bearish year behind where numerous blockchain projects have found themselves struggling financially. However, we can confidently say that we have the runway and capital for continuing to develop APEX Network into the leading Blockchain technology, and to drive adoption in the enterprise ecosystem. We aim to create valuable and innovative use cases surrounding consumer data privacy, decentralized storage, and in general further use cases in “Data+AI+Blockchain”.\\nWe expect 2019 to bring us both joy and challenges. The rollout of testnet phase 2, which includes a Virtual Machine, is expected soon. Mainnet will follow in the months after.\\nThank you for your continued support, and best wishes for the New Year!\\nSincerely,APEX Core Team',\n",

       "  'article': 'These governance models weigh heavily as some of the most critical factors of a platform such as latency and throughput — some of the most popular governance models that every blockchain enthusiast will have heard of include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). These are the most widely used consensus algorithms in the blockchain space. This article pitches the three governance models against each other to give the reader a clear view of how these governance models compare.\\nThe concept for the Proof of Work governance model was presented in 1993 before the term ‘Proof of Work’ was coined in 1999 by Marcus Jakobsson and Ari Juels. The core reason for applying the PoW model is to deter denial-of-service attacks by requiring requesters of a particular service to do work, and in blockchain’s case, computational work, before a block is submitted.\\nMany platforms have employed this consensus such that for one to mine a particular digital currency, they have to spend computational energy. Miners have to solve complex mathematical problems that require much energy. The first miner to solve the problem receives handsome rewards regarding the digital currency of that particular platform. This can be seen in Bitcoin’s case.\\n➡️Proof of Work also solves the problem of double spending in cryptocurrency. The more extensive the network, the harder it is for an individual to execute double spending because of the computational energy required to control the network. The kind of energy necessary to influence transactions in bitcoin is enough to power approximately 15 households in America; this is according todigiconomist.Herein lies a significant problem with PoW.\\nThe world is trying to go green by consuming less energy and coming up with more ways to produce green energy. The computational power required for the mining activities taking place around the world is enormous. This is against what the world is aiming for regarding energy consumption.',\n",

       "  'article': 'I’m a bit of an oddball in the tech world in that I’ve worked at the same institution for over 12 years. When I meet fellow techies for the first time and tell them this, for example at a conference, I’ll often get a surprised reaction. There’s a positive reaction at the surface (“oh, that’s great”), but also a look that conveys an underlying confusion, and perhaps even concern. If put into words, it might sound something like: “How can you stay innovative and move forward in your career if you stay at the same place for more than a few years?” Or if put into more negative terms: “You must not really care that much about your career to stick in one place that long. I’m not sure I have too much in common with you.”\\nTake this brief exchange in the movieOffice Space, between the main character Peter who’s become disenchanted with his career, and his friend Samir who’s more in the ‘just happy to have a job’ state of mind:\\nI’ve always loved Office Space, it’s humor gets at the absurdities of corporate tech jobs in a way that I haven’t come across since, plus just hilarious. But as all good comedies always do, it also points to deep and more profound questions…\\nThis exchange in particular gets at a tension in most of us, the ‘safe play’ vs the ‘fulfilling and exciting’. As the audience, we mostly identify with Peter, at how depressing it would be to stick around the same company for that long (particularly one as awful as the company that they work for, Initec). But if we dwell on this a bit more, I think most of us also identify just a bit with Samir. Does he actually have a point?\\nI think this tension is even more of an issue in the modern/western world than it has been in the past. For those of us lucky enough to be able to take the basic life necessities for granted (food, water, shelter, clothing, etc.) we’re often thinking less about how to keep and hold onto a stable job that will supply our basic needs, and are focusing more on whether or not we’re fulfilled in our careers. This dynamic is particularly strong in the tech world. Generally speaking there are plenty of jobs that will pay the bills, and the demand for programmers just seems to be growing, which puts more and more of the power into the hands of the employee tochoosea job that is fulfilling, not just whatever they can get to pay the bills.',\n",

       "  'article': 'The new year is here and there is no better time to list 3 of the most promising technologies I expect to see in production in the video streaming arena in the next months…\\nThe Video Streaming Industry keeps experimenting and introducing innovative technologies, however the transition to production is not always as smooth as we would like or expect. There are implications in terms of costs, support by consumer devices, impact on established architectures, or, in some cases, a technology is simply not good enough for the market yet. The three technologies described below have an opportunity window in 2019. We will see how many services will embrace them.\\nIn 2018, an increasing number of players offering OTT commercial services included live events in their catalog. In addition to traditional IPTV, Cable, Satellite and Digital Terrestrial distribution, service providers operating mainly on the Internet, managed to acquire rights for Prime-time sport events such as Football, NFL, etc... These events were distributed through adaptive streaming, mainly using MPEG DASH and HLS, to a wide range of different devices, from smartphones to connected TVs, taking advantage of one or more CDNs (trying) to cope with the traffic demand.\\nIt turned out, however, that a major issue for this kind of services was the end-to-end latency or delay experienced by the user, in particular when compared to traditional broadcast distribution. Currently deployed HTTP-based adaptive streaming distribution architectures are usually behind broadcast of about 15–30 seconds, reaching 1 minute or more in some cases. This is considered a key aspect in terms of user acceptance, because subscribers are certainly not very happy to pay to watch a team score when their neighbors are already celebrating the goal.\\nTechnologies exist to reduce latency, and in particular, MPEG DASH provided extensions since the publication of the Second Edition of the Standard, in 2014. However, only in 2018, with the introduction of Common Media Application Format (MPEG CMAF) support in products, we have seen implementations tackling this issue in all the important building blocks of the architecture: Encoder, Packager, CDN, and Player. First results are promising, with end-to-end delays comparable to those provided by satellite or digital terrestrial (5 seconds or even below) and demonstrators able to reach ultra-low latency (below 1 second).',\n",

       "  'article': 'A few days back, I watched Bandersnatch on Netflix. This is the first film offering from the makers of the ground-breaking dystopic science-fiction show, Black Mirror. True, to what Black Mirror represents, Bandersnatch, has altered notions of viewership and circulation in the history of the small screen. Set in 1984, the film is simply to say, the story of a teenage computer programmer who attempts to produce a highly conceptual and ambitious computer game, called the Bandersnatch.\\nWhat is the most important point of and about the film is the change in the idea of viewership. The viewer is no longer a passive viewer, but an active participant in the history of cinema. The viewer is a ‘proscumer’, a producer as well as a consumer of the film. The viewer is the story teller and the director of the film as the film progresses. From making the decision about what to eat for breakfast to what music to listen to whether commit suicide or murder, the viewer gets to control the narrative, or so it appears.\\nThis is however, not the first foray into ‘make-your-own-adventure’ storytelling. As hasbeen written, there has been much experiments in literature and in Netflixitself. I am not going to go into the history of this genre, but will try and explain what makes Bandersnatch a one-of-its kind in the history of cinema that will mark the history of not just cinema but also digital humanities.\\nBandersnatch is not the first Black Mirror special during Christmas season. In 2014, the series showed its first special, White Christmas. After four years, it has come with a new special which has, as an understatement, shaken all its viewers. This is the first ‘film’ by the creators of the show and was streamed on Netflix globally on 28th December 2018. On the first glance, it looks the usual Black Mirror staple where the human fear of being controlled or annihilated by technology plays out. But, that is where the similarities with any other Black Mirror offering ends.\\nI got to know about Bandersnatch when I chanced upon its trailer on Boxing Day on the show’s Facebook page. Like any other devout fan of the show, I was eagerly looking forward to the ‘film’. On the appointed day, I opened the Netflix website. I hovered my mouse over the Bandersnatch icon. The blurb showed that its about 90 minutes long. This appeared to me as usual. A Black Mirror special is not really of any longer duration. Bandersnatch, however, proved to be anything but the usual. It took me over three hours to finally ‘finish’ the film and over 90 minutes to actually understand that the director of the story is not David Slade. The film starts to offer you the option to ‘choose’ the moment you click the play button. Naive me, thought it is a new Black Mirror style of presenting the story. Although, the lack of the time code struck me as something odd, it still didn’t strike me till I was halfway through the film, that it was me who had the control of the story and be an active consumer of it. Much has already been written about the many endings of the show, the gargantuan amount of permutations and combinations of the film, including the final duration of the film. What I would like to concentrate on is not the possible or plausible endings, but the treatment of the film and the philosophy of the one figure who drives the film — how Charlie Brooker, the writer, doffs his hat to one of the most influential writer of science fiction in the 20th century and the one historical period that has fascinated most of the science fiction visualisations of the 21st century — the decade dominated by garish fashion and big hairdos, the 1980s.',\n",

To mark our commitment both to the industry and the unique culture that emerged in this community, we propose a new New Year. 2019 AD with its beginning on 1 January doesn’t really have much significance for us. Rather than that, we’re celebrating the year 10 AB starting on 3 January. Anno Domini becomes Anno Bitcoin.\\nAfter the massive bull run of 2017, people have been talking about 2018 as a down-period for crypto. For those of us in the industry, it has actually been the more exciting year. The bull run was a crazy period that saw the entire industry scrambling just to keep up with demand. After the rally, we were able to examine our processes and improve our foundation for the future.But the thing is, 2018 hasn’t really been a down-period. Now that the year is over, we can look back and put it in perspective. In comparison with 2017, both the trading volume and total number of trades increased significantly.\\nOn the industry side, these numbers show a very successful year, with definite growth. The reality for investors, however, is a bit different. Prices have gone down across the board, but the situation is better for some cryptocurrencies than others. There’s a belief that prices move more or less in unison — the market follows the movements of BTC. But if we take a look at the average prices over the entire year and compare that with the current price, the picture looks a bit different, with some of the 5 cryptocurrencies Bitstamp supports currently sitting much further from their average than others.\\nFor us at Bitstamp, the last year of the first crypto decade was all about growth. We continued scaling our team in all departments and reached a few important partnerships to improve our tech arsenal. In November, we partnered with Cinnober, a global independent provider of technology solutions for the finance industry, to create a new matching engine for our exchange.',\n",

Granted, I saw Drake on tour literally the week before in Oakland, but I was still super stoked and thought “Hmm, maybe I’ll randomly run into Drake while I’m here”.\\nSpoiler Alert: I didn’t meet Drake, but I did come up with a super cool idea for the culture! #DoItForTheCulture\\nIf you know me or follow me on Instagram @Kyleculus, you may have noticed that a lot of my captions are Drake lyrics. I often struggle with captions so I generally default to the wise Socrates…I mean…Drake for counsel as his songs are relatable and a representation of the grandiose lifestyle I want to live.\\nAs a huge procrastinator via Instagram, neglecting my responsibilities and scrolling endlessly, I noticed I wasn’t the only person that uses Drake lyrics as captions. Odell Beckham Jr., a close friend of Drake, actually does this all the time.\\nI have a computer science background and work professionally as a Software Engineer, so I decided to take on the adventurous endeavor to build Drakestagram.Drakestagramis a website where people can search keywords based on the vibes of their photo, and it returns them with a lyric to use as a caption.',\n",

Some of you work with maritime navigation and aeronautics, some of you need to measure long distances with high precision, and some of you (like me!) just have really strong opinions on the whole “meters versus feet” thing.\\nWe heard you, and your feedback has made the Measure Tool even better. Now you can pick from the same wide variety of distance and area units you may know from Google Earth Pro — including nautical miles, both feetandmeters, and yes, even the venerablesmoot. Just use the Measure Tool to measure a distance or area, then click or tap on the result to convert it into different units. Selecting “automatic” will choose units for you based on the distance or area you’re measuring, whether your country uses metric or imperial units, and your preferences.\\nWe hope this change will give you more power to go measure more things, like the distance fromTokyo to Manila(1,617 nautical miles), the size of theChoctaw nation(2,813,763 hectares), and the footprint ofLondon’s Hyde Park(350 acres).\\nThe ability to change units is available onGoogle Earth for Chromeand iOS today and will be available for Android soon.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Donizete (Donny) Minchillo Jr.,Pineapple Development, Founder.\\nBrazil\\nOurs is a pretty typical immigrant story. My family was very poor when I was growing up in Brazil and struggled to find opportunities to succeed. My parents saw the US as the land of opportunity and wanted to move in hopes of providing a better life with more possibilities for my brother and I.\\nWell, I was 16 years old at the time. I didn’t have much choice in the matter and as a teenager that’s difficult. I also didn’t speak any English upon arrival — so you can imagine the vulnerability of a teenage boy who doesn’t speak the language being thrown into the culture of an American high school. It was difficult to get around, to get things done, to study, to meet friends — pretty much everything was a challenge at first.\\nLuckily the biggest overhead element in our business is paying our team members, and we started with one other person besides my wife and I, so we knew we wouldn’t necessarily pay ourselves a salary at first as long as we could cover expenses, and I was fortunate to have a few freelance web development clients that agreed to come on board when I shared that I was starting an agency — so at the beginning — as long as we didn’t lose them while we were trying to also bring on new clients, we’d have enough cash flow to pay our developer. Since then our team has quadrupled and monthly revenue has increased by 500%. My wife and I didn’t start paying ourselves a salary probably until about 6 months in if I remember correctly, and we were investing profits back into things like building our own website for the business which is obviously crucial as a web development company. We’ve now grown to a point where we have other expenses like our headquarter office space in St. Petersburg, FL — but since all of our employees are remote, this isn’t something we needed right away.',\n",

I make mental notes on my Pixel, my iPad, in Google Keep, on a notepad, and discuss-it-to-death sessions with my patient wife, Rashida Shams.\\nAnd I think I have nailed it. Here is a distillation of the collective wisdom from countless books I’ve read, meetings with hundreds of newsmakers, eccentrics, philosophers, and mysticals over hedonic lunches, coffees, dinners andqawahsessions — and working with some of the most talented, inspirational people in three (3) Fortune 500 companies and five (5) startups.\\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list.There might be 11 rules.\\n#1 — Embrace your passion.Countless pundits have said this. Numerous movies made, speeches given, words spoken. There is a reason. There is no passion to be found in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living. Live by choice, not by chance. Whatever your passion, just do it. The world will reciprocate. Money will follow. Dreams will become realities. Take the first step — today.\\n#2 — Take care of yourself, first.Eat, drink, think, sleep, and live better. Research repeatedly proves this. A healthy body + a healthy mind = amazing experiences. Stretch in the morning. Eat a garlic clove everyday. Drink water. Munch less. Eat nutrient-dense foods, not calorie-dense. Last meal at the 3-hour mark before sleep. Brush your teeth. Comb your hair. Wash your face. Looking good, confidence, calm mind, bright skin, and a positive outlook are wired together. Make peace with your past. You don’t need to be better than anyone else; you just need to be better than you used to be.',\n",

The journey through this degree was not what I or many of my peers had expected it to be. Truthfully, I thought being an engineer would involve me tinkering with electronics, motors, and gizmos endlessly.\\nInstead, the following four and a half years were filled with constant learning of material my immature brain was not quite prepared for. While I believe my institution does a good job at transitioning students from high school to college, the majority of freshmen simply cannot fathom the effort and discipline required to succeed in a STEM degree. Four years of painstaking persistent dedication.\\nThis is not to say I have not enjoyed my academic experience in engineering. On the contrary, I’m disappointed now that I will not have access to the brilliant teachers and minds at my school. Yet, I think it is dangerous to enter a field with false notions of what is entailed. For one, this can result in a considerable loss of time and money. For novice engineers or those considering pursuing the field, I hope to dispel incorrect beliefs or stereotypes of an engineering degree.\\nClasses Focus on Theory and Fundamentals\\nFor the first solid year, possibly two, engineers learn the absolute basic mathematical backgrounds required for the majority of their field. Classes perform a broad exploration of various math topics. Content can often feel random, and it’s application not immediately clear. In Calculus I, topics covered include linearization, Taylor series, and various trigonometric integration techniques. I cannot remember when I last used any of the above methods or topics. Yet, this does not suggest such topics are pointless.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Inpart 3we decided that it is possible for humans — through collective organizing — to exert some control over technological developments. This brought us to two important questions:Whatwould be required to impede the deployment of SI? And,Howcan we make sure that happens?\\nInregards to thewhatquestion, we can use nuclear monitoring and Mutually Assured Destruction as a model. If many world powers create artificially intelligent agents that are poised to crossover to HLMI and then to SI, and these world powers monitor each other and set up ICBMs to destroy HLMI agents that have been “deployed,” a stalemate could be achieved. This theory assumes that we will be able to successfully monitor HLMI development. While HLMI development cannot be monitored by environmental monitoring, advances in specialized technologies could facilitate monitoring of government entities and corporations with the capacity to develop HLMI. An analog to the Bioweapons Anti-Terrorism Act could be enacted to criminalize private citizens developing HLMI. While monitoring all private citizens capable of developing HLMI would be challenging, the level of computing power and specialized skills required would shrink the pool significantly.\\nYou might be thinking — do we really want to create an international monitoring agency that will monitor private citizens with powerful computers?Idon’t want that. But Ireallydon’t want to jump on the Bostrom train either — pushing down the gas pedal on SI development and putting the hopes of human survival into a highly uncertain method for controlling SI. Would a global monitoring system be any less dystopic than the various possible existential catastrophes Bostrom outlines? We have accepted monitoring systems for nuclear testing, and we were close to doing the same for biological weapons — why wouldn’t we do the same for an equally terrifying threat to human survival?\\nSide note:A halt on HLMI deployment does not mean a halt on all technological developments. Halting HLMI would not, for instance, impede important medical advances that use machine learning but are extremely specialized. These medical devices, while incredible, are not “generally intelligent,” and neither — for that matter — are self-driving cars or SIRI. Just because technologies do certain human tasks very well (e.g. driving or speech recognition), does not mean that they have Human Level Machine Intelligence (being able to do almost all human tasks as well as the average human).\\nInregards tohowquestion, I think that the progression of artificial intelligence improvements will naturally attract mass interest in SI.Huge numbers of people will be pushed out of jobs due to improvements in specific artificial intelligence. If those people can be made to see that mechanization is the true driving force behind their suffering — rather than being distracted by scapegoats like globalization and Mexicanization — then there might be enough anti technological advance momentum to impact political decisions. Maybe when 3.4 million Americans are replaced by self-driving vehicles mechanization’s downsides will become unavoidably obvious. But, we must not assume that it will. To impede the power of scapegoating, we need to spread this discussion to the people who will be most impacted by job loss from specialized AI.',\n",

Luana And The Lizard Girls didn’t happen, but Eno’s stated aim (to “drag together a bunch of bizarre people”) came to fruition when sessions began, two months later, for his first solo album,Here Come The Warm Jets.\\nListen toHere Come The Warm Jetsright now.\\nNot that the musicians Eno gathered around him could — or should — be described as “bizarre”, exactly: more that their disparate and contrasting styles represented a determined (and career-long) desire on Eno’s part to encourage fresh and intuitive modes of thought, eradicate boundaries, and throw the mixture up in the air and construct enduring art from the falling fragments.\\nAmong those filing into London’s Majestic Studios in September 1973 were guitarists Robert Fripp (King Crimson), Chris Spedding and Paul Rudolph (Pink Fairies), bassists John Wetton, Busta Jones and Bill MacCormick (Matching Mole), drummer Simon King (Hawkwind), and a clutch of Eno’s former Roxy Music bandmates. An all-star assemblage, but the results were mercifully free of the extended jamming one might have expected, cleaving instead to Eno’s subversive avant-pop tendencies.

What many first time entrepreneurs don’t learn till later is that it’s not a one way street. Founders need to do just as much due diligence on their investors as is done on their company. Even fewer realize that fundraising etiquette runs both ways.

       "  'article': 'Since the iPhone was introduced people have been making wishlists, concept arts, and 3D renders of the “next iPhone” as the years have gone on they certainly start to look better and be more accurate.\\nIn this article, I’ll look over the ugliest and strangest iPhone concepts that I can pull from the depths of the internet. Get ready to vomit.\\nObviously ,this was an iPhone 5 concept. I think what makes it really ugly is partly the square home button, wider screen, and plastic/rubber volume buttons. I don’t think we’ve ever seen an iPhone that can fit 5 apps side to side, and I know that at least since the iPhone 4 we have had metal volume buttons, and obviously only had two styles of home buttons — ever.\\nThis phone was given the strange name of the iPhone 3GSRE, to be launched after the 5S. It almost looks like an iPhone 4, but obviously ,this was made before the 5S (Pre iOS 7 design and home button with a square in it). What I find weird about this phone is also the volume buttons, I don’t think we’ve had an iPhone with volume buttons with a dip in it.\\nThis was an iPhone 3GS concept. This concept has so many things wrong with it. From the antenna bands to the somehow off looking home button, the centered camera, and front camera and earpiece. I cannot even stand to talk about all of the problems that I see, from this pre-Spotify looking Spotify, the Phonify on the back (probably just the name of the renderer) and how big the screen would be from scale of the icons at the top.',\n",

       "  'article': 'There are currently many means of exchange in national monetary systems. The monetary base includes central bank notes and bank accounts; commercial banks accounts denominated in both national and foreign currencies; and foreign currency in the form of bank notes.\\nIn addition to these traditional means of exchange, at the end of the 20th century, e-money that could be emitted by non-bank financial institutions began to grow in popularity and adoption. Complimentary local currencies based on credit as a means of exchange also became increasingly popular. In the 21st century, the range of exchange instruments expanded due to virtual currencies including cryptocurrencies.\\nThe emergence and expansion of these new private means of exchange raise questions for regulatory authorities as to the best way of regulating their emission and circulation. Choosing an adequate model of regulation demands a full examination of their economic properties and attributes. One of these new means of money circulation that is yet to receive an official interpretation is decentralized credit networks, which allow for the exchange of goods without a bank acting as an intermediary.\\nThe credit network model has the form of a weighted graph, where the value of the graph corresponds to economic agents, and the value of the graph’s edges represents the amount of credit an agent is willing to give to their counterparty.\\nIn a centralized credit network, there is only ever one participant to whom all other participants directly provide a loan. In this model, the provision of credit by ordinary network participants to each other is only made possible through the mediation of a person or institution who is at the center of the network.',\n",

Another factor that triggered popularity is the idea of money that is not controlled by any government, but by the people.\\nBlockchain lets us run a public record of transactions which ensures the legitimacy of all transactions and the rules are implemented from the very start through the technology itself and the smart contracts they use.

Due to the massive popularity of Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the number of transactions has skyrocketed and issues have become apparent.\\nThe time to complete a transaction went as high as 78 minutes per transaction and the fees went as high as $50.

I am a professor, and if a student regularly made offensive remarks in class, I would meet with that person and try to persuade him or her to desist. (For the record, this has never happened to me.) If the person continued, I would at some point seek to ban the student from my class, with the support of my university.\\nYet this solution is not as straightforward as it seems. Maybe it’s good if you trust my judgment, but it is not readily scalable. It only works because such incidents are so rare.

By using social networks, messengers, all online apps we have been partly showing our inner self to the others. Digital have just structured and focused it in one point or network node\\xa0, if you will\\u200a—\\u200aour phone. Those tales about GDPR and other data protection measures tell us that our minds are no more privately closed as they used to be. Undoubtedly, IT giants have too much power over a steering wheel, however, being proactive subjects or passive stones it’s our choice to make.Below I figured out some rules we can use to collectively protect ourselves in the world of digital.\\nRenaissance philosopher Campanella wrote a book called “ The city of sun”. It’s known as the first utopia ever written. He’s managed to describe an ideal city from both ruling and living standpoints. Equal rights and wealth distribution, secure life, efficient work segmentation, self organization, deified humanity\\u200a—\\u200athese are main features of this clockwork-like divine city. Even though a prophetic start-up of Italian renaissance era have never been materialized\\xa0, its idea permeated the minds of his followers (one of the most modern\\u200a—\\u200awas Jack Fresco). If fact, digital world created quite hostile environment for these ideas to find real life applications. In particular, online communities became\\xa0, suffice to say, digital cities of sun. I wish Campanella could observe this. All in all, such an architecture can give us much more power than we’ve ever held in our collective hands.\\nSuper-fast flow of information and world changing rate demands new through organization technics. By means of specific digital measures people can live an easier life by decreasing the informational load at least in half. This can be done by organizing your digital self.\\nAlgorithms are cornerstones that software architects use to make us do what they will in response monetize: likes,shares and so on and so forth. They achieve it by exploiting our pscycological vulnerabilities. Intermittent variable rewards, sudo-free choice mechanisms, FOMSI(google it ), social approval\\xa0, social awareness\\u200a—\\u200athese triggers of their digital guns aiming to confuse our minds. However, It have been not so clear that pretty anyone can operate this variables to digitally control oneself in one way or another.\\nBesides we all had our minds digitalized, as I wrote above, let me put it this way: digital makes shots from the parallel side of the mirror, when we are not seeing it. It’s a perfect way to reflect on what we are doing and self-monitor our lives: our bad or good habits, misdeeds. If we used it,we could, it term, easily draw conclusions of our doings. Moreover, these mirrors have an ability to save,on programmer’s slang, log files or, in other words, your activity. There is a saying:wise men learn by other men’s mistakes; fools by their own.In digital era we all have an opportunity to be wise\\u200a—\\u200awe only have to use it.',\n",

For most old-school companies that were founded many decades ago, this often means reworking many of their core processes and fundamental beliefs.\\nHere are a few tech-pioneered concepts and processes which could prove particularly transformative for more traditional, less “tech” companies.\\nIn many traditional industries — whether it’s restaurant supplies, TV advertising, or supplement manufacturing — it can take potential customersweeksto get a simple price quote for their order. You have to speak to multiple different reps (often telling them the same information), navigate opaque monopolistic supply chains, get multiple quotes to understand if you are being scammed or not, among other painful, mind-numbingly tedious tasks. To say the process is inefficient would be an understatement.\\nBut the thing is, now that we as consumers know that a seamless process is possible, our expectations have changed. This type of seamless process is not just “nice-to-have” at this point.

       "  'article': 'Android smartphones are great, but notifications and certain settings can make life more difficult than it has to be. Here are a few ways to optimize your device.\\nByEvan DashevskyandJason Cohen\\nPCs, tablets, smartphones — even ourcoffee makers— can wirelessly connect to the internet at the push of a button, and devices buzz with emails, notifications, and status updates at all hours of the day. But it’s hard to imagine life without yourSamsung Galaxy Note 9orGoogle Pixel 3. Fortunately, there are ways to avoid some of these small irritations and make your day just a little bit calmer.\\nHere are some facts that should be completely unrelated: 1) AT&T is my wireless carrier. 2) AT&T owns DirecTV. 3) I am not a DirectTV subscriber. However, a DirecTV remote app came pre-installed on my phone. And I can’t delete it. Welcome to the world ofbloatware.\\nBloatware is a blanket term used to describe pre-installed apps that take up space and resources on your phone. These apps — many of which you’ll never use — come courtesy of your phone’s manufacturer, carrier, and Google itself (plus a few licensed third-party apps thrown in for good measure). If you look through the apps on your phone, you’ll almost certainly find a bunch of apps you never downloaded and will never use. While bloatware is not unique to mobile devices, it’s most insidious on phones because of the limited computational resources, compared tothose on your home PC.',\n",

We gained valuable insight into marine conservation research and projects which brought fresh perspectives on how Last of Ours can bring fun and awareness to the masses to help protect wildlife and restore their habitats! Here are some highlights from our trip as well as the projects we had the pleasure of learning from.\\n🏝 The inauguralRotto Tech Festwas a full day onRottnest Islanddedicated to marine conservation and how technology is being used to collect, analyze, and interpret data. AsLast of Ourswill be referring to real-world data for our NFT species count and impact tracking, we were extremely excited to see the innovative techniques that researchers and engineers have come up with to study how we can best protect our planet’s marine species.\\nDid you know that columns of seawater contain valuable information about the species have passed through there? As marine animals move through the water, they leave a piece of their DNA behind via skin cells, scales, hair, excrement… you name it. Scientists have found a way to extract this DNA from water samples to analyze which species had been there. The DNA isolated and characterised from sediments and water is calledenvironmental DNA. eDNA can give us a glimpse of biodiversity, food web dynamics, diet analysis and invasive species monitoring.\\n🔬 First described in 2012, the use of eDNA in water was demonstrated as an example to characterise vertebrates living in the sample. Since then, numerous studies have emerged to investigate the potential of this approach inbiosecurityandbiodiversity assessments.MetabarcodingeDNA has become feasible thanks to the ability to simultaneously sequence millions of copies of DNA from complex multi-species environmental samples.\\nProfessor Mike Bunce, head ofthe Trace and environmental DNA (TrEnD) laboratorypresented his lab’s work at Rottnest to showcase the strides they have made thanks to this technique. They also have a partner program with other research labs to integrate baited remote underwater video (BRUV) technologies and eDNA as a cutting-edge tool to give us insights into how we can best manage various marine ecosystems.',\n",

       "  'article': 'More than 1,000 years. That’s how long recent estimates suggest it would take in some developing countries to legally register all land — due to the limited number of land surveyors in country and the use of outdated, cumbersome, costly, and overly regulated surveying and registration procedures.\\nBut I am convinced that the target of registering all land can be achieved — faster and cheaper. This is an urgent need in Africa whereless than 10% of all landis surveyed and registered, as this impacts securing land tenure rights for both women and men — a move that canhave a greater effecton household income, food security, and equity.\\nThe question remains, how can we register land and secure tenure at scale?Perhaps one of our answers can be found in rural Tanzania where I recently witnessed the use of a mobile surveying and registration application. In several villages, USAID and the government of Tanzania are piloting the use of theMobile Application to Secure Tenure(MAST), one of several (open-source) applications available on the market. DFID, SIDA, and DANIDA are supporting a similar project.\\nThe process of mobile land surveying and registration goes like this:\\nTechnology truly reduces the barriers to entry as it enables the participation of all community members– from the initial informational meeting to the confirmation of boundaries with neighbors, or as part of the team handling the application. Perhaps what was even more encouraging was the inclusion of youths and women in the teams, as they are often not given access to land and participation in land-related discussions in patriarchal societies and customary contexts.',\n",

       "  'article': 'As spotted on Reddit, the creator of this perfboard clock notes that one can lose track of time when working at your computer for extended hours. While thereisnormally a little clock in one corner of your screen, more than likely you fail to look at it, and whenever your eyes wander off-screen to — you know, stare off into space — that little clock is nowhere to be found in your line of sight.\\nTo help with this very modern problem, theTime ‘O’ Time clock was designedusing six 8-segment bubble display modules, vaguely reminiscent of miniature Nixie tubes. The assembly is creatively soldered on a pair of perfboards, sandwiched together via header pins that allow for disassembly as needed. Power is supplied through the USB port of a laptop computer when used as intended, although any USB power source would also suffice. When disconnected, time is preserved using a CR3032 battery, so it doesn’t have to be reset ever time it’s plugged in.\\nAn ATmega 8L chip controls the clock, which keeps track of time using an internal oscillator. While this gives a reasonable accuracy of +/- 8 seconds per day, the project write-up mentions that it would have been better to use an external crystal for this duty. If and when it does need to be reset, each of the hh/mm/ss digits has its own dedicated button, which should make setting the time convenient when needed.',\n",

But, while they can range in price anywhere from a couple hundred to a couple thousand dollars, a large percentage use the same controller chips. Timo Birnschein’s Acton Blink Qu4tro is a fairly high end model, but that controller meant the remote was still frustrating to use. So,Birnschein designed his own open source remote.\\nBirnschein’s Open esk8 Remote works with anyelectric skateboardthat uses the nRF24L01+ chip for wireless communication — which is probably most of them. It addresses many of the frustrations found in OEM remotes included with these mass-produced electric skateboards, including better battery life indicators, improved throttle control, and more consistent communication. It also feels a lot more solid, which is an important consideration for a device like this.\\nInside Birnschein’s remote isan Arduino Nano, an nRF24L01+ breakout board, a DC/DC converter board, a throttle potentiometer, a power switch, LEDs, micro switches, a buzzer, and 2 AAA batteries. To build this, you’ll needa 3D printerfor the body of the remote. To make the PCB you’ll need a small mill, or you can simply send the design out for professional fabrication. Thanks to Birnschein’s hard work reverse-engineering the NRF24L01+’s wireless communication protocol, you can build your own remote that works much better than the one that came with your electric skateboard.',\n",

FromGoogle Cloud Study Jam, which introduced developers to platforms likeKubernateesandDockertoGoogle I/OExtendedevent,which touched on Android and Google Web technologies, also to theWomen Tech Makers Event,which was an avenue for women to learn more and get involved in the tech community. There was alsoFlutter Study Jamwhich helped developers get familiar with the Flutter technology for Mobile development. The last which wasDevFest Lagoswhere GDG Ibadan actively participated in presentations and planning.\\nIn all of these events, we had many developers learn from various facilitators within and outside the community and their contributions have made the community grow significantly well.\\nIt will not be good to end our 2018 story without mentioning that two Engineers from the community (in the persons of Goke Obasa and Yemi Olaoye) who Doubled as our top Organizers relocated to Germany in pursuit of their career as Software Engineers. This happened to be one of our top highlights for the previous year.\\nThe introduction of the Google Hangouts LIVE eventAsk Me Anything with Devsformed part of our avenues to reachout the more to everyone, encouraging them to grow and invest in themselves to be better at what they do especially in terms of acquiring technical skills and being able to solve problems with technology. We are happy to announce that there were many positive reports from members of the community. Many have learnt from all the sessions and are currently putting lessons learnt to use. We will like to thank our Speakers on these sessions for their time and for their willingness to give back, We thankAbiola Ibrahim, Emmanuel ObidiegwuZaga,Omoloro Oyegoke, Yemi Olaoye,Goke Obasaand Funsho Popoola.

In order to help with this job, he’s building a sorting machine. He previously created acard feeder mechanism, and in part two of this ambitious project, he’s come up witha lazy susan-like deviceto place the cards in 22 separate rectangular holders made out of cardboard. This is meant to accommodate the 21 sets of cards in the Wold of Warcraft universe, plus an extra container for unidentified cards.\\nThe machine is constructed out of wood, and turns with the help of steel balls to reduce friction, forming a sort of gigantic thrust bearing. A stepper motor powers the rotating surface, with cardboard strips formed into gear teeth to interface between the two. AnArduino Uno, along with a motor shield provides control, and when fully implemented, the device will use a homing sensor to ensure the correct tray is in place under the feeder mechanism.\\nWhile an impressive display of cardboard craftsmanship, the assembly will still need to be integrated with the feeder, plus a method of identifying the cards. It will be interesting to see it come together, and as of now, it’s great reference material for any projects requiring a large turntable.',\n",

Something about the bright, flashing colors just makes electronic dance music all the more fun to bop along to — or however you’re supposed to dance these days. Breakdancing or something, maybe? Anyway, if that’s your thing,Amy Goodchild’s awesome tutorialwill walk you through how to build an interactive FadeCandy LED dome that’s perfect for your next dance party.\\nWhen in Domeis a 4.2 meter (about 14 foot) geodesic dome with the interior covered in 4,378 individually-addressable LEDs. I imagine that dancing inside the dome probably makes one feel like they’ve been transported into a David Guettamusic video. Goodchild designed and builtWhen in Domeas the final project for her Master’s degree in Design for Performance and Interactive at the Interactive Architecture Lab of the University College London Bartlett School of Architecture.\\nGoodchild has also made the plans available, so you can build your own! The structure of the geodesic dome is constructed using a hub kit fromBuild with Hubs, which is designed specifically to be easy to assemble. The finished dome is made up of 33 triangular panels, and those are split into 11 sets of three panels each. Each set of three gets 512 LEDs and oneAdafruit FadeCandy LED controller.\\nProgramming the LED controllers is where it gets quite complicate, but Goodchild provides a thorough explanation. The FadeCandy server needs to be setup with an accurate map of the LED layout, which is handled by a dymaxion map that unfolds the 3D shape into a 2D surface map. Processing is then used to coordinate animations.A Kinect Sensoris used to make those animations interactive. The result is a beautiful LED dome that is well-suited to your next EDM breakdancing battle.',\n",

Basically, Root access enables one to not only access the system files lying at the so-called “Root” of the OS but also modify them.\\nIt’s a magic tool to customize, tweak, tamper the OS of an android device to get the best out of it by acquiring root permissions. Magisk not only grants root access but also has various features like systemless root and different modules. Magisk can be well defined as “A Magic mask to Alter System Sytemlessly. ” Some of the key features and modules are explained below:\\nIt’s a feature which allows system modification without notifying the system. Magisk stores modifications in the boot partition instead of modifying the real system files. OS doesn’t detect any tampering and unaware about modifications which makes the Magisk obscure to the system.\\nThe “Systemless” method makes it possible. Nowadays many developers useGoogleSafetyNetfeature to detect the System modifications so that some actions can be performed for example apps like Google pay app and Netflix uses it to detect and restrict rooted devices from accessing the app.',\n",

Depicted was an error message one user had received when sending a transaction, but something about the message wasn’t adding up to developers, since it directed users to what was discovered to be a malicious GitHub repository with a malware version of wallet.\\nAccording to SomberNight the user who received this error message was likely using a legitimate Electrum client, but connected to a maliciously operated Electrum server when they attempted to broadcast a transaction. When the transaction couldn’t resolve, the client displayed the user the malicious error message, which directed them to install malware that would have prompt users to enter and subsequently steal any private keys.\\nIn order to increase their chances of intercepting transactions from clients the attacker created multiple servers in what is commonly referred to as a sybil attack. The rich text error message users who connected to the malicious servers received is a throwback to bitcoin dev code where it was used to report back errors to users like low incremental fee, missing inputs, or other issues could crop up.\\nOnce the team caught wind of the attack a patch (3.3.2) was issued to the client but it was not a long term solution, as SomberNight explained: “This is not a true fix, but the more proper fix of using error codes would entail upgrading the whole federated server ecosystem out there…”',\n",

You only need to issue the following commands and you're there:\\nThe problem with this approach is that Homebrew's OpenMPI formula is not versioned. Therefore, anytime you update/upgrade your Homebrew's formulae, then you'll get a new version.\\nYou can selectively upgrade the formulae you want, and stick to an OpenMPI version as long as you wish, but what if you want a specific version? you cannot do that.\\nDevelopers using OpenMPI usually run their jobs in a High Performance Computing (HPC for short) cluster. These kinds of clusters are not upgraded as soon as someone releases a new OpenMPI version.\\nIt happened that the HPC cluster I work with is 2 or 3 versions behind the OpenMPI latest release. When administrators finally upgrade the version, then I need to tweak my local OpenMPI formula and point to an older version. That's not trivial. The only way to do that is looking at full commit history of thehomebrew-coreproject, identify the commit where the version has been upgraded, replace the local formula, and then deal with merge conflicts whenever you issuebrew update.\",\n",

Once people are on a high street, the value of their spend and activity, and its impact on local economic growth cannot be underestimated. The further use of technology on our high streets has an important part to play in increasing this much needed commercial activity.\\nA study by staff at New York University, Future Cities Catapult and Center for Inclusive Growth, found that occurrences of on-street technology — specifically the Links deployed by LinkNYC in partnership with the City of New York — seemed to create uplift on surrounding commercial activity. The study notes that in areas of Brooklyn where Links have been deployed, there was an average uplift of 2.4% in retail transactional activity in surrounding businesses, something they note to be reasonably significant. The same study found that the presence of bike-sharing tech in Jersey City increased business in nearby food establishments by around 4%.

       "  'article': \"October 31st, 2018 marked the 10th anniversary of Bitcoin and it was celebrated exuberantly across the globe. But the question is, do all of us really understand what the underlying technology — blockchain — is, and how it is different from and much more than just Bitcoin?\\nWell, before we go deeper into comprehending blockchain, let’s understand what Bitcoin is.\\nBased on the years' old concept of cryptography, Satoshi Nakamoto (an unidentified individual or group of people) wrote a whitepaper for Bitcoin that was published in 2008. He had successfully created a system that would go on to show the world a financial system that negates the use of all kinds of intermediaries.\\nBitcoin has two parts: Bitcoin token and Bitcoin ledger/blockchain.\\nSo, yes, Bitcoin was the first ever blockchain to be developed and put to use along with its own cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. But, in 2013, Vitalik Buterin, set out to invent his own blockchain that would improve the inefficiencies of Bitcoin (the blockchain).\",\n",

This may be a convenient storage method, but when playing music takes up both hands, it’s a bit inconvenient to reach over and swipe the screen. To help his musician brother out with this conundrum, hacker “mosivers” came up with awireless foot pedal for turning pages.\\nHe first attempted to spoof a capacitive input on the Kindle’s touchscreen, but after some initial success, he found this method to be impractical, and decided to instead go the Wi-Fi route. This involved first jailbreaking the Kindle, then installing several pieces of software and creating a page flip script to be executed remotely.\\nAfter all of that preparatory work, it was time to build the physical unit. It uses a NodeMCUESP8266dev board to generate a web server, which allows for linking between the two devices without any intermediate Wi-Fi connection. The programmed board was then secured in an enclosure in order to hold up repeated toe taps, with a pair of buttons used for changing the page.\\nWhile this hack is meant for musicians, mosivers notes that it could also be useful for those with disabilities, or even for those who simply find hand swiping inconvenient.',\n",

They are almost always accompanied by their best friend — their laptop!\\nAll throughout history, there have been numerous search operations to find these rare, mysterious creatures. The desire for a peaceful environment has forced these entities to hide in the dark corners of the world. So, these habitual programmers are now considered to be nothing but mythical creatures found only in the virtual dimension.\\nOkay. Now if you believed any of that and are probably thinking that you can never be a habitual programmer (or perhaps if you’re thinking of how foolish this all sounds), here’s some good news — Habitual Programmers are all around you. You can find them in your class in the form of that classmate who completes his programming assignment without fail. You can find them in your office in the form of that colleague who is always on the lookout to learn new programming concepts. Heck, you can even find them in your nearby park enjoying the beauty of nature (and perhaps thinking about how to debug their code). To cut to the chase — they are everywhere!\\nBefore describing who is a Habitual Programmer, let us understand what is a habit. Habits are the small decisions you make and actions you perform every day. To in other words, a habit is a routine or a behaviour that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.\\nNow, a Programmer is someone who is not only capable of writing code or building and designing software, but someone who desires to learn about new techniques, has the ability to think outside the box, knows how to communicate effectively while not compromising on his physical and mental well-being.',\n",

These are a combinations of learnings and observations garnered from being on both sides of the table across various life cycles of tech companies. Over 10+ years of looking outside-in as an investment banker, advisor, mentor, now early stage VC (focused on interactive entertainment/gaming) and as a complete insider incepting, building, operating and even winding down a company.\\nThe most important learning has been that nothing compares to the journey of an entreprenuer. As an investor the experience of having been a founder helps hone into insights, instincts and intellectual muscle that perhaps ordinarily may not have developed.

Inputs include large amounts of data and hefty doses of power. This may seem trivial but recall than when the world went crypto-crazy a year ago, entire countries noted the power-usage spikes. That’s loads of powerful GPUs causing energy spikes on a national level. It’s not trivial. (This reminds me of Obama’s big EV push that established committees to review grid/power issues but no significant power-infrastructure investments — that’s how you knew they weren’t serious. Millions of EVs on the road … .where was the power going to come from?)\\nAnyway, compared to humans, computers are remarkably inefficient — with both data and power. Humans can supplement inadequate data with imagination (I suppose one could draw an analogy to regressions, but computers fill-in-the-blanks poorly compared to humans and still require much more data). And the human brain is remarkably energy efficient.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Do you ever wonder how successful companies start their thought process in creating products these days? I’ve always been fascinated by how they think and what drives them to create and innovate. How is it that they see things most people do not? What might seem mundane to us could seem profitable to them. What can we learn from how they think and how they see the world?\\nOne of the innovators I look up to is Casey Neistat — an American film director, producer, and popular YouTube creator. He said,“If the reason why you’re doing something creative is to make a living, then you are doing it wrong. You get into it because it’s your passion and it’s something that you really believe in.”What I got from this is that the art of innovation starts with the aspiration to make a difference as opposed to profitable gain. Creating purpose means that you can and are changing the world. However, if you do happen to change the world, you would also likely be earning from it. But if it’s the other way around, if you start off with the sole desire to make money, you probably won’t make money — you won’t even change the world. The truth is, you would likely fail. So, determining how you can find meaning and how you can change the world would greatly increase your chances of success.\\nLet’s take a look at some of today’s leading innovators and how their products made a difference — Apple, Google, and YouTube. Apple wanted to make computers accessible — they wanted to bring computing power to everyone; Google wanted to make information available to everyone; and YouTube wanted to enable people to create videos and make it easily available to everyone. These companies started by wanting to make a difference. Today, they are already very successful in their respective fields and are changing the world as we know it.\\nAnother lesson we can learn from innovators is the ability to see what others cannot and be the first to jump the curve. Let’s have another look at two successful startups in history — Uber and AirBnb. These companies have revolutionized the fields of transportation and travel by harnessing the power of technology. How? They simply saw the idea of “sharing” and how it could take over their industries like nobody ever did and capitalized on it through the use of available technology. They have challenged traditional industries through the apps they have created and have since reduced customer journey steps, making everything easier and faster. These tech titans, now recognized as “killer companies”, radically changed the game and are now changing the world. It’s a matter of perspective — not getting stuck in a stagnant or comfortable state by being smart and finding better ways. I guess most successful innovators are not waiting for progress; they are a little bit forward-leaning by trying to make progress happen.\\nTo create is to innovate and to innovate is to improve what’s already been built. In a time wherein there’s already someone, somewhere who has created what you thought was unique, you have to see things in a different perspective in order to be successful. Have what it takes to be a creator — find an idea and build on it. Once you find your passion for creating, who knows? You could be the next big content creator or CEO of a startup company! Just make sure that you take that first step towards your goal.',\n",

       "  'article': 'This will be the first year in many (maybe 5+) when I don’t intend to be at CES. I’m looking forward to it!\\nCES gets close to 200,000 attendees and thousands of exhibits spread out over multiple venues. My first visit, the wait for the taxi line was over an hour even though the ride was 12 minutes. The wait to getoutof the cab at the venue was another 10 minutes. Fortunately, Uber has cut down the wait time and it’s maybe 30 minutes to get from the airport to the venues.\\nOf course, getting between the main venues can also be a wait. For the five minute drive between the Sands Expo and the LVCC and the one time I decided to take the shuttle, it was over an hour to get from point to point. Walking for about 30 minutes door to door is the most reliable way. I had seen nearly a 6x Uber surge in between meetings.\\nOver time, I learned how to pack lighter for CES and hone the schedule. Here’s some distilled knowledge:\\nLast year, I had 30 meetings setup over 36 hours and either I or the other party was late about 70% of the time, cascading into being late for the next meeting. Follow up from CES can also be difficult. You wait a few days for everyone to get back home and then the excitement of whatever was presented in the meeting is muted.',\n",

       "  'article': 'In many ways, 2018 has felt like a transition year for the marketing industry. We have witnessed first-hand a shift in attitudes as the sector has realised data science is becoming no longer a luxury but a necessity. Its application is unquestionably challenging marketing to be more data-driven than ever before. Here are some reflections on 2018 and predictions for this year:\\nMeasurement is still critical\\nThe size of the prize in data-driven attribution and measurement in 2019 is huge, for two standout reasons. Firstly, an opportunity: data can now be collected and analysed at a scale that enables a better understanding of the customer and their path to purchase than ever before. Secondly, the problem: the same driver of the opportunity in data is resulting in a rate of evolution in AdTech and MarTech with which most marketers can’t keep up. Each new technology, channel or tool adopted creates its own data silo and increases the gap to a holistic understanding of the customer.\\nFor these reasons, we believe measurement and attribution are the necessary enabler for data-driven decision making in every facet of marketing. Forrester’s Wave supports this, showing that marketers are increasingly calling for measurement tools that can help them deliver content that effectively targets individual customers. Fortunately, the expectation for what data-science and AI can deliver here are starting to be matched by the reality.\\nNot only will a data-driven approach increase the ROI of emerging channels but it has also been proven to renew the effectiveness of traditional ones in 2018. The remarkable resurgence ofbillboard advertisinghas been driven to a large extent by the fact that the channel has ‘progressed to the point where advertisers can now track nearly all of the same metrics with a billboard as they can with a digital ad’. It’s a fascinating story of how data and measurement have resurrected a ‘relic of the past’ and opened up exciting opportunities for marketers.',\n",

AI solutions consists of technologies collaborating to find connections within enormous data sets (synonymously known as Big Data). As it pertains to social media marketing, current AI tools are highly valuable for content creation, strategic planning and reporting.\\nChat bots and virtual assistants have become increasingly ubiquitous, but this is only the beginning. In the future, chat bots will use “colloquial APIs” to respond to customers queries in a more human-like form. Currently, the automated service revolution has become prevalent in e-commerce sites and on messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Back when I was in elementary school, I used to read a lot. I mostly read fiction, but nevertheless I would read often. However, with the greater penetration of technology and social media into my life, my reading hobby died down to a point where it was merely a chore I did for school. Although I wasn’t reading, I still developed my passion for science and technology and improved my knowledge in these areas through sources like YouTube videos, blog posts and articles.\\nBut during the summer of 2018, I realized something: compared to YouTube videos, blog posts and articles, the quality and quantity of the content in books are at a different level. A YouTuber at most will spend a few days working on scripting, shooting and editing a video. Similarly a short blog post or article won’t take more than a few days of work. But a book takes years of planning, writing, and editing to get published. Also, whilst anyone with an internet connection can upload a YouTube video or write a blog post, a book goes through a huge amount of quality control before it’s published. After understanding the relative value of books as a medium to grow my knowledge and understanding of technology, I decided to start reading regularly again and set myself the goal of reading a book each week or 25 books before the end of 2018.\\nBy today, the 1st of January 2019, I’ve read 23/25 books, which I’m pretty happy with. Over the course of these 6 months and 23 books, I learnt a huge amount and I also feel that I have grown more as a person. Of course not all 23 books taught me a lot and had a great impact on me, but the following 15 books did. I have ordered them from least to most impactful and shared a bit of information about each book and the lessons I learnt from each of them.\\nI picked up this book purely because I was familiar with Sinek and his idea of Starting with Why and its effect on an audience. I first watched Simon Sinek’sTed Talk, Start with Why,around the beginning of middle school, and it has shaped the structure of my writing, speaking and thinking processes. “Start with Why” builds on the idea of the golden circle that’s brought up in the Ted Talk. However, in addition to focusing on the power of “Starting with Why” as a communication tool, Sinek illustrated a variety of examples to emphasize the importance of having a why and shaping one’s day to day activities around this why. He explains that be it an organization or an individual, progress requires a clear understanding of why they get out of bed every morning.\\nAlthough I’m not a big fan of soccer, I picked up this book because I am a fan of Mathematics and Data Science. In Soccermatics, David Sumpter uses a lot of match data coupled with mathematical reasoning and analysis techniques to explore the math behind various aspects of football: from formations to bicycle kicks. He also uses match data and a bit of Machine Learning to predict future match results, which he then put to the test by betting on them. Though Sumpter’s explanations were a bit boring at times, some results were quite interesting and I found it really interesting how Math can be applied to almost anything- even football.',\n",

       "  'article': 'One of the tech-companies I find very interesting is Uber. The challenges they seem to encounter in different markets makes it a very interesting company to watch and the unique solutions they often come up to better adapt to local conditions, at-least in my eyes, show why they are a market leader in the transportation industry. At this stage I believe their strategy has evolved to trying to become a marketplace for transportation that gets you from point A to point B regardless of the mode of transportation. So be it through an electric scooter or a bus, the vision is that Uber would be the go to platform to get such transportation.\\nWhat I find quite intriguing and inline with the aforementioned strategy is the recent launch of Uber Bus in Egypt and how a similar initiative would be aptly suited for the Southern African market. As someone who has studied, worked and lived in South Africa I understand that the impact of such a launch on the South African market would be significant to say the least.\\nClose to 70% of all private transportation of individuals is through the minibus taxi industry. These minibus taxis are largely informal, have a designated route and pick up people from anywhere between the point where the route begins and where it ends. Customers pay in cash and taxis often drive recklessly and take detours to compete for clients, making it difficult for passengers to predict arrival times. People use this as a mode of transportation for everyday travel for both leisure and getting to and from work. According to the South African National Taxi Council, taxis transport about 15 million commuters daily, if we assume the average fare is R15 (thumb-suck) then we can put the size of the industry at around R82 billion. Assuming a smartphone penetration of 35% (Pew Research puts it at 51%, but the numbers could be skewed by smartphone users who have more than one smartphone) this would put the total addressable market for ride hailing in the taxi industry at around R28.4 billion (5.2 million commuters a day), presenting an obviously an amazing opportunity for Uber or any other player with the gall and capital to invest in an Uber Taxi type alternative.\\nUnderstandably one of the biggest concerns with trying to step into the taxi industry’s turf is the likely backlash from the taxi industry. Historically, the launching of transportation options that potentially disrupt the taxi industry has created a lot of friction that has manifested in the form of violence. In many cases this has been averted through partnerships with the Taxi industry. Projects such as the MyCiti (bus rapid transit service in Cape Town) and the Gautrain averted these issues by through dialogue with taxi associations. For example, the launch of MyCiti in Cape Town involved Transport for Cape Town (TCT) buying out operating permits for taxi drivers operating in the City Bowl area with drivers receiving significant payouts as a result of this, limited permit buyouts in townships. This model drastically reduced potential conflict.\\nSimilarly, Uber/Taxify could approach the matter by looking to form a partnership with a select few Taxi companies that operate routes and has taxis that are in excellent condition in areas that are suburban areas or areas close to the metropolitan that are more heavily populated with working age middle-class demographics (according to FNB’s retail segment data this includes anyone earning a gross salary of between R7000 — R60000 per month) that are heavily populated with the objective of targeting the market segment that lies in the middle-class, uses taxis to get to work and have access to both a smartphone and a bank account. I would assume that this is the demographic that would most likely already know the brand, have a high smartphone penetration and a higher employment rate (they need to get to work on a daily basis).',\n",

We rely more heavily on our technology each and every day. My devices are a part of me and have attached themselves at my hip for more reasons than one.\\nFull disclosure, I’ve had Apple devices for the last 7 years, andI just recently purchased a new iPhone. When Apple released the first iPhone nearly 12 years ago, they kickstarted a new platform and method of keeping their customer base from switching to any other device, convenience.\\nWe constantly look for convenience in everyday life, which trains to take to work, ordering food ahead, or basically anyone who has an Amazon Prime account. Apple has captured that idea in every product they’ve released in the last decade preventing users from going to their competitors.\\nTimeout, let’s be clear, there is actually nothing preventing one Apple customer from a switch to say, a Samsung device or the new Google Pixel 3. For the most part, there are extremely capable and much more affordable devices out there without a fruit logo that will do just fine. But Apple does it’s best to bring you in as a user once and knows that it likely won’t have to do much to keep you there.\\nUnbox Therapymentioned this recently while discussing the limitations Apple has created for itself in Asian markets with no “budget” smartphone options. Apple customers are stuck on that early innovation that Apple found in the early 2000s. They are still riding on that iTunes, iPod, original iPhone wave that has led us to devices like the iPhone XS and the iPad Pro.',\n",

All the variants of touchscreen technology carry their own distinctive characteristics, with individual benefits and limitations.\\nIf you push your finger on the screen and it collapses slightly, then it means it’s resistive. And you’re in big trouble. There are two plates under the screen that are not too close but not too far to each other and a continuous electric current passes through them. When you press your finger on the screen above, the two plates touch each other(not in an NSFW way) and the electric current at that point changes. And after that, the software does its job.\\nThese types of phones don’t care what type of pressure you apply, they work on their own. If you don’t believe me, go ahead, buy one. These phones don’t care about you so much that they have the possibility of sending love letters to your crush on their own. Stay a mile away from these.\\nCommonly used for industrial purposes, capacitive phones don’t work with pressure, they work with anything that transmits electric currents or receives. In these types of phones, there is something like a grill that’s either made of copper or indium tin oxide. When we touch the screen, the current between the stylus and the grill is made.

Here’s our list of the very worst.\\nWe all knew that gene-edited humans would one day be born, but nobody wanted it to happen so soon, and definitely not like this.

       "  'article': '7,674,374,208 is the number of people currently populating our modern world, yet millions have never felt more alone. We live in a hyperconnected generation in which we have the ability to contact another person instantaneously, whether he lives five minutes or five hours from us. The internet is a platform for unique individuals to relate to users who share common interests or hobbies. It is a place to stay informed about current events. It is a scaffold where human beings can learn, watch, or read about any topic they desire. Nevertheless, as the internet becomes increasingly accessible around the globe — connecting billions of strangers — users tend to put their best faces forward, concealing the reality of the somber emotions behind it. Sadly, this is one explanation as to why depression and suicide rates are higher than ever.\\nWith each new application on the market that promises happiness amongst users, society is being deceived into becoming more and more addicted to their phones. This sport, which consists of scrolling and streaming, spurs isolation from friends and family; thus leaving the most important type of connections — human interactions — as one of our lowest priorities. Between 2010 and 2016 the number of adolescents who suffered major episodes of depression and loneliness increased by 60%. This considerable growth can be attributed to the enslavement teens feel towards their phones since the launch of the iPhone in 2007, Facebook in 2004, Instagram in 2010, Twitter in 2006, and Snapchat in 2011. Our overwhelming obsession with posting, liking, and scrutinizing every moment has gotten out of control. The new reality is that instead of watching concerts, we record them; in place of eating delicious meals, we photograph them; rather than joking with our friends, we tag them. Ultimately, we prefer to view life rather than experience it.\\nAs a teenager, I constantly hear my parents reminisce about the times they would play outside until sundown, only returning home to eat at the dinner table with their own parents. This may seem like a cheesy scene out of an old movie, but devoting time to spend with family (a tradition that many have given up on) used to be an integral part of many children’s lives. Research from the Journal of Marriage and Family shows that teens who allocate quality time for their families tend to lead happier lives. Despite this fact, young adults consistently give up sharing stories at the dinner table in favor of locking themselves in a dark room and binging-watching Netflix shows. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide rates for white and black children between the ages 10 and 17 have increased by 70% and 77%, respectively, between 2006 and 2016. Unfortunately, our generation withholds the knowledge necessary to take action and stop trends similar to these from developing, but we don’t know how to enforce it.\\nWhat should be a simple task — setting down our devices and seeing the world with our own two eyes — isn’t as straightforward as it seems. Tech gurus specialize in pumping out new games and features that light up our reward centers, making it feel artificially good for us to zone into the harsh fluorescent screen. Yet, it is these Silicon Valley innovators who find themselves instituting tech-free homes for the sake of their children’s health and happiness. If the experts are also the ones who most fear the internet’s vast capabilities, shouldn’t that be a clear warning to change our habits?\\nWe used a tool designed to enhance our well being to aid in our mental destruction. It is our obligation to resist the seclusion of the omnipresent cyberworld so we do not miss out on the lives we deserve.',\n",

       "  'article': 'One of the key features of blockchain is its consensus mechanism. Necessary for the distributed ledger to function is ensuring the entire network of participants collectively agree with the terms of the contract. The purpose of the consensus is to verify the validity of the information being added to the ledger, to prevent double spending and other invalid data from being appended to the blockchain and to keep the network from being derailed through forking. There are a number of different consensus mechanisms out there. The most popular are the Proof of Work and Proof of Stake systems. All of them aim to solve the Byzantine Generals’ Problem but none of them provide a perfect solution.\\nWhat is the Byzantine Generals’ Problem\\nThe definition of the Byzantine Generals’ Problem is bestdefined on CoinCentralas “a term etched from the computer science description of a situation where involved parties must agree on a single strategy in order to avoid complete failure, but where some of the involved parties are corrupt and disseminating false information or are otherwise unreliable.”\\nThe Byzantine armies surround a city, ready to invade but they need to attack at the same time. The city is not strong enough to fight back against the entire Byzantine army. But the Byzantine army will only win if they attack at the same time. To make a decision, the generals of each army have to send a messenger back and forth to deliver the message. If the messenger gets caught or sends the wrong message, the Byzantine army will fail. There is no way to guarantee the authenticity of the message. How do they create a trustless system that ensures victory in attacking the city?\\nProof of Work (PoW)',\n",

       "  'article': 'For years now, researchers have confirmed that smoking increases one’s risk of mortality. Both heavy smoking, and more recentlylow-intensity smokinghave been linked to increased occurrences of death in various populations.\\nIt has also been said that “sitting is the new smoking”, that sedentary behavior is just as bad for one’s health. Internal studies conducted by our data science team have shown that sitting, is actually in fact worse. Vivametrica’s founders have been studying the effects of physical activity on health and chronic disease for over 20 years, this research has been the basis of our proprietary risk analytics. More interest in studying the impact of sedentary behavior on human health has arisen. Sedentary behavior has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in patients withChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Another study, which looked at the combined effects of watching TV with smoking found these factors to be co-morbid incancer-related mortality.\\nVivametrica conducted a study using 10-year mortality data to compare our risk prediction model to a traditional insurance risk model (>2000 person sample). The initial data sample, including wearable device data, was collected 10 years ago. As part of this study, we also performed individual variable assessments to determine the effects of specific factors on mortality.\\nSteps-per-day (habitual physical activity) was the strongest predictor of mortality. Individuals who took fewer steps than the average for their age and gender were 5.4x more likely to die after 10 years compared to those who took more steps. When we looked at smoking status alone, we found that smokers were 1.2x more likely to die after 10 years compared to non-smokers. From these results, it can be said that physical activity has a greater impact on overall all-cause mortality than smoking in this study. Thus, increasing efforts to modify sedentary behavior with smoking cessation can help people to live longer. Getting people to move more seems to have an even bigger impact than stopping cigarette use.\\nOriginally published at theVivametrica Blog.',\n",

       "  'article': 'An entirely new breed of apps is gaining momentum, DApps. DApps are not owned by anyone, they run on the blockchain, and technically their backend code is running on a decentralized P2P network.\\nCrypto pundits and the community defined criteria that a DApp needs to meet in order to be considered the obvious, a decentralized app. First, it must be open source and the source code of the app to be available to all network participants, and anyone can check and contribute to the code. Secondly, it has to use blockchain technology to record transactions which anyone can refer to at any given point. Thirdly, it needs to be fueled by tokens or digital assets. Lastly, it needs to generate tokens and have an inbuilt consensus mechanism like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).\\nDApps propose a paradigm shift in the way we view software models. A world running on decentralized apps will be remapping the technological landscape. Why? Just because they are distributed, transparent and incentivized mechanisms open to all network users. The increasing development of DApps has opened up the possibility of an exciting new world, dominated by decentralized gaming apps likeCryptoRome,Endless DiceandSteem Monstersas well as token exchanges such asIDEX,BancorandKyber.\\nOn the contrary, not all crypto space-related apps survive or end up delivering on their technological ambitions. Although, the crypto environment has given a plethora of ICOs and ideas, over time these have faded. After the 2017–2018 hype in new ICOs, only few of the original and innovative projects survived. As we move into 2019, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done as the majority of DApps do not, yet, appeal to the vast majority of people.\\nHave an opinionated take on this?

But the first question is “How is JavaScript executed both in front-end and back-end?”. For front-end, it’s much easier to understand it because JavaScript is executed by browser.\\nWhat about back-end ? Without browser, how JavaScript is executed ?\\nSo it’s time to learn Node.js !\\nNode.jsis a program allowing you to run JavaScript outside of browser. It means that if you install Node.js, you can run JavaScript on your PC, on your server.Technically, Node.js is built with Chrome’s V8 engine which is written in C++.

This more than doubles the number of cities the company serves in the England and Wales. The new areas are Brighton, Cardiff, Coventry, Liverpool & Warrington, Oxford and Reading. The company is expected to announce its expansion in Scotland in early 2019.\\nOn one hand, the gig economy has been booming during thiseconomic expansionof nearly a decade. Investors are on a lookout for the Uber and Lyft IPO in early 2019, with Airbnb and Instacart to follow. On the other hand, it seems like we are headed towards another recession. How will the gig economy react in this mist of all this?\\nEven though, some experts say that recession could go in favor of the gig world as more and more people will see it as a necessity to pick up gigs and make extra income. Adam Roseman, Co-founder and CEO ofSteadyhas different views. He says that the recession, which brings both layoffs and wage cuts, would increase the supply of workers even further with fewers gigs to pick up.\\nIn a nutshell, there’s no doubt a recession will leave more people looking for gig work, it could also deflate the gig economy.',\n",

       "  'article': \"The world 50 years ago compared to modern days is an entirely different atmosphere. Grandparents would read books and newspapers, all being beneficial to the to the mind. Now, people will stare at a cell phone; reading what they see on social media, becoming highly influenced by mythical statements created only to play devils advocate with whomever they please for attention. The effects of AI or technology is creating psychological disabilities beginning with millennial's and spreading throughout other generations. millennial's grew up with easy access to technology such as smartphones and mobile laptops, thus becoming part of their everyday life. That created anxiety, depression, and shortening attention spans. Technology is becoming a toxic innovation to the growing society weakening morals and sensitivity to violent acts towards people.\\nLiving in a world where technology does not exist is nearly impossible. A day without an alarm clock, cell phone, or computers has become unfathomable to adolescents. Essentially, the pace of technological advances has immensely increased over the last few decades to ease our lives and provide us more opportunities. It is undeniable that technology has changed our lives, tech critics argue that the Internet and other related technological gadgets have a deleterious effect on the human brain performance . However, tech critics only see one side of technology and neglect to mention the new intelligence that technologies have brought us. Furthermore, the existence of technology has made an incredible difference in the generation we live in by transforming global development, improving people’s lives and sparking innovation. A well-known professor from California State University named Larry Rosen, has created a correlated term to use for the diagnosis he calls an iDisorder. An iDisorder is where you exhibit signs and symptoms of a psychiatric disorder such as OCD, narcissism, addiction or even ADHD, which are manifested through your use — or overuse — of technology.\\nNicholas Carr is a brilliant writer who strongly believes and has a firm vision of the internet’s neurological effect on the brain. Throughout his article, “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” he feels that “the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle” due to the rise of the internet. Carr reflects on his own experience of his years spent online and blames the internet for being the reason why he tends to get “fidgety” after two or three pages. He makes a big assumption that the internet is responsible for the rest of the society’s declined critical thinking. The dynamic of the internet alone demands the technique of skimming, we are losing the ability to read deeply and, by implication, to think deeply. Adolescents whom grew up with various amounts of technology do not have the chance to develop critical thought and creativity; weakening vital skills needed to survive in the world. The way people use social media and internet is bouncing from one place to another, making it extremely difficult to concentrate on one task such as simply reading a novel. Nickolas Carr admits “I can’t read War and Peace anymore”\\nBefore technology was yet to exist, face-to-face interactions were a normal everyday encounter. Today's society there are severe cases of social anxiety. The unceasing celebration of the self — epitomized by the “selfie” photograph — has atomized and alienated the individual. Before, people would start off the day by looking at someone of importance to them such as a mother or significant other, nowadays the majority will start the off by subconsciously looking at a cellphone or some sort of gadget. Statistically, it takes approximately 21 days to create a habit. Which is silently lethal for anybody to own a mobile device. They become addicted to looking at their phone every 5 minutes, or waking up and checking social media feed, same thing for post sleeping. It has created problems in the educational system; students have been granted easy access to the internet utilities and have allowed them to easily locate, copy and paste answers into their homework assignments. The effects of exposure caused some to not be aware that it is creating reliability. Access to the internet has made plagiarism a part of several students’ academic careers, within has a contradiction, that being technology is a huge distraction from student staying focused on homework.\\nThe invention of technology main purpose was to fill void, need, or want, creating an environment of simplicity. But, as technology grew it brought with it disorders, addiction and cognitive loss. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have slowly become a faster and more convenient way of sharing news, communication with friends and relatives across the world. Although citizen journalism has now become so cheap that anyone with a smart phone can transmit news anyhow, there have been instances where people have come to know of the gruesome deaths of their relatives and friends through uncensored posts on Facebook or WhatsApp. However, social media has became quite demoralizing and exposing the world to horribleness. Exposure to these types of graphic content develops immunization to what is known to be morally incorrect. In today's time, most of the human aspects of life revolve and are controlled or affected in someway by technology. Many people would find it hard to cook without microwaves. Technology had a goal originally set in place; it was to simply make human life easier, and it did in some ways, however the simplicity became a habit to the way people live their everyday lives. People became reluctant without it, something so simple as to driving from point A to B became a challenge without the use of a GPS or smartphone.\",\n",

       "  'article': 'Enmatière d’abus de marché, l’IA vient poser de nouveaux défis juridiques. Ces nouveaux défis ne résultent pas de la création de nouvelles méthodes de réalisation d’abus de marché, mais du fait que les nouvelles technologies, et notamment l’Intelligence Artificielle, font que ceux-ci prennent une toute autre dimension.\\nAu sens du Règlement n°596/2014 [1], l’abus de marché se décompose de plusieurs catégories d’infractions : les opérations d’initiés, la divulgation illicite d’informations privilégiées, et les manipulations de marchés. Si les deux premières catégories relèvent d’un accès suivi d’une divulgation d’informations non publiques dont par conséquent l’IA ne peut avoir connaissance et ne peut donc générer de risques systémiques sur les marchés, cela n’est pas le cas pour la troisième catégorie. Les manipulations de marché sont définies, à travers d’une liste non-exhaustive, à l’article 12 du Règlement, remplaçant les articles 631 et suivants du Règlement général de l’AMF. Il y est notamment mentionné certaines manipulations de cours auxquelles il faut être particulièrement attentif dès lors qu’il y a usage du Trading algorithmique à haute fréquence, (par exemple à l’article 12 2.c du Règlement). Nous étudierons, au prisme de la pratique deMarket-on-the-close(A) et de celle de l’Abusive Squeeze(B), en quoi l’Intelligence Artificielle (en sa définition la plus inclusive possible) génère déjà des abus de marché afin d’illustrer les risques encourus par les marchés financiers dans le cadre d’une généralisation de ces agents autonomes.\\nIA et Marking-the-close\\nLeMarking-the-close[1bis]est le fait pour un agent financier de réaliser « des achats d’actions ou de dérivés à un instant très proche de fermeture du marché de façon à altérer le prix de clôture »[2]. Si un tel procédé n’est pas illégal en soi, la répétition de celui-ci dans des proportions permettant une influence sur les cours peut constituer une manipulation de cours. De plus, un tel procédé est suspectéa fortioride manipulation de cours s’il est suivi d’annulations des ordres passés. Car, pour tout investisseur extérieur, les informations disponibles sur l’état du marché de l’actif financier visé sont celles répertoriées dans le carnet d’ordres passés.\\nDès lors, pour une entreprise réalisant ce type de procédé, le fait d’effectuer cela à grande échelle entraîne que « la représentation pour tout opérateur du carnet d’ordres et de l’état de l’offre et de la demande […] est faussée (sic) »[3]. En effet, compte tenu du caractère anonyme des opérations passées, « l’algorithme (peut) interpréter les flux de marché avantageusement par rapport aux autres intervenants » dès lors que seul l’émetteur de l’ordre est en mesure d’identifier ses propres ordres et donc d’avoir une vision réelle des ordres qui seront par la suite maintenus et effectués.',\n",

       "  'article': '【Published by Ding Bao Xiu (丁宝秀)】\\nOn January 2nd, Damo Academy has released the “Top 10 Trends of Science and Technology” in 2019, covering smart cities, digital identity, autonomous driving, graph neural network systems, AI chips, blockchains, 5G. Alibaba’s Damo Academy has focused people on cutting-edge technologies that truly create value, providing theoretical support and a source of imagination for the technology development of 2019.\\nIn 2019, AI remains the hottest topic in the tech world. If 2018 is the year of AI steps out from laboratory and step in\\u200b\\u200bto our reality “world”, we believe in 2019 is the year of a new starting point for the full cooperation between humans and AI tech. Damo Academy believes that real-time speech generation on mobile devices may not be distinguishable from live voice, and even voice AI will pass the Turing test in some specific conversations. There will be more and more talking facilities in our cities in the future.\\nDamo Academy believes that biometrics will enter a large-scale application phase in 2019. In the past few years, many people have become accustomed to going out without a wallet and cash. In the future, the era of going to the world without an ID card will not be too far away. With the rapid spread of 3D sensors and the integration of multiple biometrics, each device can “see” and “listen” which in other words, they become “smarter”. Biometric and vivo technologies will reshape identity and certification. Digital identity will become the person’s second identity card.\\nIn addition, the Damo Court believes that in 2019, 5G will lead to a new application scenario, 5G will greatly enhance mobile bandwidth, provide a peak rate of nearly 100 times that of 4G, and enhance connectivity to 10 billion levels.',\n",

The show is about 5 friends who found a tech company in Silicon Valley and their hilarious journey through entrepreneurship and friendship. The clip below is from season 4 and sets the stage for my review of the very cool technology using machine learning to identify foods from photos.\\nAs funny as this Silicon segment is, it would be hard to admit that the technology demonstrated by Jian Yang isn't impressive. To think that you could take a photo of any food and your phone would automatically recognize it is pretty cool. To take it a step further, if the technology could break down the foods nutrition facts and then log it in a food diary for the user- that would be incredibly valuable. The applications for a technology like that range from diabetes management to weight loss to allergic reaction prevention. It might appear as if this is an improbable machine learning abstraction, but if you look closer you will find that this technology is very real.\\nLose it\",\n",

The stereo playing the beat laid on the bed next to the mic stand and I remember freestyling about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. It was 2006 and the business of music was entirely different. Limewire was still the beast it was and I spent most of my middle school days online sharing my music on Bebo & Myspace with SoundClick players and YouTube videos. Feel old yet or were you even around then?\\nToday’s climate of distribution and consumption has evolved well beyond pirating music via torrent software. Much like the transitions from cassette to CD, CD to mp3 and now mp3 to streaming, we are currently living in the next transition, immersive technology and decentralized music blockchain platforms. But what doest that mean and how can the industry, the artists and the various stakeholders stay ahead of the curve?\\nBy 2021, virtual & augmented reality, cryptocurrency and other blockchain technology is expected to make waves into the mainstream. A treasured experience of traveling to a record store and playing that brand new CD in your car will change to paying musicians in crypto and receiving access to a virtual reality album release party. Every time a transition occurs as a byproduct of technology, the industry can’t keep up and a window opens for artists to take back more control. And as technology becomes readily accessible to consumers and market developers, the idea of independents disrupting is a greater possibility. But with anything, a financial investment is required to convert noise into purposeful attention. But this is were the new artist development walks in.\\nAs the industry adapts to the changes of technology, artists have the greatest opportunity to retain ownership and rights in how their intellectual property is exploited. Gone are the days of middlemen controlling the logistics of how your works can be distributed and consumed. We live in an era were creatives get to explore, innovate and add their contribution to culture. Musicians have the ability to segment current and potential fans and tailor experiences for those segmented audiences. Whether you have the infrastructure to take your music to the world or create a hyperlocal experience for your die hard fans, it’s time to get the most creative.\\nJulian Keatonis the founder ofStereo Assault, a full service culture curation agency, talent manager and music business educator.',\n",

We opened our eyes for the first time as a company to a whole planet actively taking massive strides at being a kinder and more accepting place to live. In effort to capture this magic our office sat down, shaking off the glow of holiday gluttony and that “one” drink on New Years, to reflect on the top moments of 2018 that deeply inspired us. Naturally, we looked inward to our very own values as the guide to our thoughts. We must admit in doing this we all had a “holy shit” moment when we realized what a prolific year it has been for us all.\\nHere is our official 2018 review inspired by our values:\\nWe embrace all forms of diversity from ethnicity to experience. The process of building harmony can be messy but the results are powerful and more than worth it.\\n1.)Hollywood woke TFU to the fact that movie goers are craving stories that reflect global culture and represent difference in an authentic and somewhat epic way.Groundbreaking movies like Black Panther, Crazy Rich Asians and Oceans 8, which earned $700m, $250m and $300m at the box office respectively have finally proven that minority casts and women can deliver blockbuster returns in their own right.\\n2.) 2018 was the year of women in action.From #MeToo mobilizing deeper impact in every industry to Oprah’s speech at the Golden Globes to the female takeover of the Midterm elections to women driving in Saudi Arabia to the Royal Wedding of Megan and Harry we watched first after first that changed history.',\n",

You should be aware and knowledgeable of all aspects of what Digital Market offers to its audience. If you are a graphic designer; learn Photoshop, InDesign, but also study UX, web development, Marketing/Social Media Strategies. The more you understand of Digital Marketing conceptually and the various facets/marketing vehicles it offers and how they work; the more marketable you become as a Potential Hire. Furthermore, by learning all aspects of this field, it can help assist your creativity and/or make your Marketing strategies more effective.\\nKeep Learning. There are several online tools and courses available for anyone to continue their education and practice. A lot of resources are free and there are several Digital Marketing Experts who have insightful online blogs, courses, Twitter Chats, etc. that one can take advantage of.

Building upon the success of the last two installments, the SugarCRM Sales Kick Off is all set to take Monterey, California, by storm and set the stage for a successful year for the Cupertino-based company.\\nSo what’s in store? Well, lots of good stuff for one. The Sales Kick Off itself is basically an event that brings together the sales teams of a particular industry to share insights, business practices, strategies and more for a collective improvement across the board. Last year’sSugarCRM Sales Kick Off FY’19 in Italy was one of the biggest events of 2018 and included a number of different hands-on training and workshop sessions for all SugarCRM Partners. A lot of it is still under wraps about this year’s event but we can rest assured that this year’s event will surely include:\\nTo increase Sales, you need all your cogs working coherently, and this includes knowing the products inside out. At SugarCRM Sales Kick Off, expect Sugar to conduct thorough hands-on training on a number of products, both old and new, to ensure all of their Partners are up to speed with the new and improved versions in order to sell better. SugarCRM must have multiple products lined up for 2019 so its a safe bet to assume these hands-on training sessions are going to hold something unique for all those in attendance.\\nNetworking, the golden chalice of business relationships. SugarCRM Sales Kick Off will bring together Sugar Partners from all over the globe to interact, engage, and discuss all things Sugar. This is an excellent opportunity for Sugar Partners, Sales representatives, and Executives to connect, share insights and collaborate for collective benefit. Certain industries in certain regions of the world might be using aSugarCRM Customizationthat is unknown in another region. Events such as Sales Kick off present an excellent opportunity for cross-regional collaboration.\\nThe SugarCRM Sales Kick Off also serves as a celebration of the previous year’s success. With an eye for exquisite locations, each SugarCRM Sales Kick Off is held at fascinating locations across the globe for a bewitching experience. This year’s event will be held in Monterey, California and is set to be the biggest one yet.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Researchers and technologists alike are excited about the rise of blockchain technology, which is foretold to be the next colossal innovation that will help companies garner wealth and resources. This, clearly, seems to have caught everyone’s fancy. So, what exactly is it?\\nAn append-only ledger, in a blockchain, users can add new information, without editing, erasing or adjusting any previous information. That is why the data is stored in the form of blocks using cryptography that links contents from the newly added block into the one that is already existing before it. The technology is designed in a manner that any change to the contents of a previous block in the chain would invalidate the data in all the blocks after it. Purely driven by consensus, it works on the principle of network and connectivity of a large number of computers thus reducing malicious transactional invasions by an attacker.\\nThere are orchestrations and applications of older principal technologies that are combined to create a blockchain. They are the private key cryptography, a ledger and an incentive to service the transaction such as security and record-keeping. Purposefully, possession of a combination of public and private cryptographic keys create a secure digital identity and reference. The amalgamation is seen as a dexterous form of consent and also regarded as a digital signature, which, in turn, provides control of ownership. Since the technology accommodates a large network of validators, this remains one of the blockchain’s most attractive attributes since it amasses large computing power.\\nAt the same time, if we’re to distill the usage of the blockchain, the primary benefit of the underlying technology is to address the problem of double-spending. Predominantly used in the creation and maintenance of cryptocurrencies, the blockchain is susceptible to counter issues where there is a risk of a holder sending copies of the same bitcoin into different transactions advancing the notorious double-spending.\\nA block is created with the details about the transaction and is broadcasted to all the nodes each time a new transaction takes place. A reference to the previous block in the chain is carried by every new block with a timestamp, thus establishing a sequence of events. The new block gets linked to the previous block when the authenticity of the transaction is proven. When such a chain of blocks is replicated across the network, all of them are cryptographically secured which makes hacking virtually impossible.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Okay, I confess. Sorry, Siri, but I find you and Alexa creepy. I worry that native intelligence is being replaced by “artificial intelligence,” which strikes me as a modern-day oxymoron, like “virtual reality.” I’m scared about what’s coming as technology takes over our lives. And I’m nearly convinced robots are going to make humans unnecessary if not extinct. Call me crazy, but that’s what they called Jules Verne too.\\nIt seems I’m in good company. Some pretty big names in science and technology have also expressed concern about the inherent risks AI could pose. They include the late physicist Stephen Hawking who told the BBC several years ago that, “the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.” Elon Musk, engineer and head of Tesla, has said that autonomous machines could unleash “weapons of terror,” comparing the adoption of AI to “summoning the devil.” And Bill Gates is worried that AI is only viable if we make sure humans remain in control of machines.\\nAs one techie posted on Tech Times.com, what happens if Siri decides that she wants to take over the world? He didn’t seem to think that was a real threat, but what if AI becomes so advanced that it decides it wants power of its own? Others worry that if artificially intelligent systems misunderstand a mission they’re given, they could cause more damage than good and end up hurting lots of people.\\nA lot of folks are worried about the implications of AI-controlled weapons. They might be able to help soldiers and civilians in war zones, but they could also cause a global arms race that could end up being disastrous. According to a scientist at the Future of Life Institute, “There is an appreciable probability that the course of human history over the next century will be dramatically affected by how AI is developed. It would be extremely unwise to leave this to chance,” he argues.\\nThere are also troubling ways in which AI could infringe upon our personal privacy. Facebook’s recent problems have already demonstrated some of the possibilities, from unwanted intrusion to exposure that leaves us vulnerable. Facebook can already recognize someone by the clothes they wear, the books they read, and the movies they watch. What happens when government agencies have fully developed recognition systems?',\n",

       "  'article': 'Healthcare Informatics has brought around a large amount of change within the Healthcare industry. The creation of new technology continues to impact and reshape the industry while improving the way doctors provide medical care. The benefits from each technological achievement work to bring us into a better future in healthcare, while eliminating systems that clearly do not provide the most accurate information.\\nHealthcare Informatics has taken the place of medical records and different healthcare systems to streamline the industry. Many of the developments are physical changes we can see such as new programs and systems for medical records and patient to physician interactions. Aside from the physical, there are other changes that continue to benefit and make way for the successful future of healthcare informatics.\\nPatients Taking Interest In Their HealthA great improvement that has been seen over the years informatics have been implemented, is the increase of patients taking an interest in their own health. Because patients now have access to their medical records and diagnoses, they’ve been more apt to stay up to date on appointments, which medications they should be taking, as well as their diagnoses and symptoms. This is also true in the fact that through patient portals, patients are able to speak directly to their doctors and nurses when they have any questions, concerns, or need something such as a refill on medication.\\nKnowledge and Communication Has IncreasedThere are so many different specialists in the healthcare industry that most patients are seeing multiple physicians on a yearly basis for different reasons. A huge advancement with healthcare informatics is how connected medical professionals are. Communication and sharing of information among each physician helps to provide patients with the best care possible. Keeping all information in one place that is easily accessible provides the knowledge needed to diagnose and treat patients with less unanswered questions and decreases the possibility for a misdiagnosis.\\nThe best outcome from healthcare informatics is the increased level of quality care. Freeing up time from our medical professionals by having new technology and healthcare information systems creates not only quality care, but safer care for patients. With proper diagnosis’ and efficiency from medical staff, insurance companies, hospitals, and patients all save money in the long run. Thecontinued growth of healthcare technologywill transform the future of the medical industry.',\n",

       "  'article': 'As we bid farewell to 2018 and look ahead to the next 12 months, it is no surprise to hear that things will only progress more quickly. Leading enterprise robotic process automation (RPA) software company, UiPath, predicts that “everything will be accelerated in 2019”.\\nThe company has newly released its top five predictions from some of its senior leaders. Kulpreet Singh, managing director EMEA, reckons the pace of automation will increase as large-scale RPA implementations advance rapidly in the region. He says they will be “turbo-charged” by the spread of expertise through widely available training programmes, new open marketplaces and the maturation of internal centres-of-excellence.\\nSingh adds that such implementations will progress more quickly in the EMEA region than other parts of the world, especially when it comes to deploying attended software robots in a wide range of settings.\\nUiPath also forecasts that automation will be “democratised” through global vendor education initiatives and that senior executives will back RPA and it will be easier to gain senior executive sponsorship for automation because its benefits have become so obvious.\\nWhile the predictions have far-reaching effects for workplaces and the world of business, they are both positive and indicative of howtechnologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and roboticsare being embedded into workplaces and work practices. There is still a great deal to be done and those leaders that have distanced themselves from digital transformation programmes must roll up their sleeves and get stuck into what needs to be done to advance their organisations into the digital era.',\n",

       "  'article': 'It’s a new year and I’m deciding to do a few things differently.\\nI work completely online now. I am constantly on my computer or my phone for work. I love that I can work as easily from my couch as in a library as an airport. Sometimes I still want a job that I get paid to do away from the computer, but the mobility for my international life really helps. I also have family and friends across the world, and the only way to talk to them is if I have some screen handy. I love that I can be there for friends and get news from home quickly. I love having my Mum or brother at the other end of the phone in a second — as easy as it is if we lived in the same neighborhood.\\nThe problem is everything in between, when twenty minutes after I picked up my phone to look up something, I’m watching kids getting surprised by puppies and whoever Ellen just had on her show. That is on the good days of distraction. We all get addicted to scrolling through random posts, but this year, I want to read more. I want to write more. I want to spend more time thinking instead of being told what to think. I already deleted Snapchat because I couldn’t handle it all.\\nJust recently I was waiting at the Doctor’s office and of course, was scrolling through emails and Instagram. I had a flashback to what waiting rooms were like before smartphones. It was lucky if there were a pile of magazines in the corner. There weremanymoments spent sitting and looking at walls. In the car, if I forgot my book, I was subject to whatever music was on the radio and whatever was interesting outside the window. Thankfully, Ireallyliked books, so most of the time I was happy with waiting wherever. I just know there were many times that humans used to be forced to think for themselves and now, those moments seem to be much less frequent.\\nI’m starting with taking the advice from many articles and taking my phone away from my bedside. Still on ring, if there’s an emergency, it’ll be in my office. My bedside table will hopefully fill up with books and notebooks instead. When I was younger, I used to fall asleep with a book and wake up to read a bit before going downstairs and starting the day. It’s something that I think 2019 will welcome — plus I like coffee now so it’s an adult version. No Instagram allowed.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Our mission atWorkpathis to redesign how healthcare is delivered. To make this possible, we’re creating technology in 2019 that leads to transparent healthcare for everyone, including patients/consumers, healthcare professionals, healthcare employers, and more. When this happens, complete visibility can help patients and their families make informed choices. In addition, it can increase trust in the patient/caregiver relationship while improving the quality, safety, and efficiency of health systems and other healthcare providers. In short, transparency is critical toward our effort this year to move toward a higher performing healthcare industry at large. But how can technology help? First, let’s understand the push toward transparency over the years and where we’re headed in the year ahead. Let’s dig in.\\nHow the Push for Healthcare Transparency Began\\nThe Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines transparency in healthcare as making all information on quality, efficiency, and consumer experience clearly available to the public in a reliable and understandable manner. When done right, transparency efforts in healthcare can dramatically influence the behaviors of patients, providers, payers, and others to achieve better outcomes.\\nIn the early part of the 20thcentury, Ernest Codman, M.D., a pioneering Boston surgeon, introduced the “end result idea” to highlight the importance of following up with each and every patient — and publicly reporting the results. Codman’s novel idea at the time was based on the theory that complete transparency would promote improvement throughout the hospital, encourage greater physician education, and improve patient choice at large.\\nWhile the foundation for patient transparency was set years ago, it wasn’t until 2001 that the IOM published recommendations for increased information availability, so that patients and families could make more informed choices. The IOM report brought attention to the need for a standardized set of performance indicators for safety, patient satisfaction, and outcomes to be made public. The movement toward informed healthcare choices was reinforced by proponents of Consumer-Driven Health Care (CDHC), an often-debated, market-driven approach to healthcare based on publicly available information on price and quality of care to encourage informed shopping for high-quality, low-cost healthcare.',\n",

Consistently throughout the whole day, my reaction after every person leaving the main stage, was:you nailed it!Thats rarely the case when I go to conferences.\\nFirst of all, I was happy it was a lot about people — in the end, machines, robots and AIs wont be bias and evil, unless we, the makers are. So right people and diversity is more important than ever. Not only for the sake of good, but if you want to succeed, it’s the more certain path with asmarter team.\\nTo quote the Obama, (yeah, he you probably heard about before!) on Future of Technology recently: he couldn't make the right decision if he didn't have a diverse team around the table.

       "  'article': 'While looking back at the past year, one thing becomes crystal clear: streaming has grown massively in 2017 and will continue to expand rapidly in 2018 and beyond. In fact, streaming has become the primary revenue driver for both music and video, thereby radically changing the way people consume content and profoundly altering the manner in which the industry and artists deliver media to fans.\\nDigital music downloads are quickly decliningand being replaced by streaming, and it’s easy to understand why this is occurring. For the price of a single digital album download, consumers can gain access to tens of millions of songs via streaming services. And a growing number of music fans are making this switch, with over 100 million people now subscribed to such services around the world. According to the RIAA’s 2017 mid-year report, the U.S. recorded music industry experienced a 17% revenue increase in the first half of this year in comparison to 2016, and the primary driver of that growth is streaming. While total digital revenue accounted for $3.2 billion, or 84% of the total industry value, an impressive 62% came from streaming, equaling $2.5 billion.\\nVideo streaming revenue is also growingat a staggering rate with no signs of slowing down. According to a report by Research and Markets, video streaming revenue is forecast to increase from $30.29 billion in 2016 to an incredible $70.05 billion by 2021, as consumers continue to embrace pay TV and OTT solutions for streaming videos. Moving forward, it’s expected that OTT will experience the most substantial market growth rate based on the increasing use of digital platforms for the branding and marketing of products.\\nAmong other things, streaming powers the growth of digital distribution, creating more opportunities for independent artists. The world of independent music distribution has also expanded greatly over the past year, as a growing number of artists move away from major label deals to harness the personalized attention that indies can provide. UK-born companyDitto Music recently opened 12 new officesworldwide to serve its flourishing roster, while digital distribution and services companyFUGA has signed a dealwith London-based Ignition Records, following its expanding partnerships with a multitude of labels, including Epitaph Records and Ultra Records. EvenGoogle is getting into the musicindustry with a big investment in the new US-based digital music distribution startup UnitedMasters, which was founded by the one-time President of Urban Music at Interscope Records, Steve Stoute.\\nNot surprisingly, the competition for streaming dollarshas been growing exponentially. One of the biggest recent stories wasDisney’s announcementthat it is severing its distribution deal with Netflix in favor of launching its own streaming service in 2019. And now it isofficially confirmedthat Disney is buying some of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets, including the Fox movie and television studio and a share of Hulu, which will allow Disney to increase its television production to provide exclusive content on its forthcoming streaming offering.',\n",

       "  'article': 'Thanks to constant improvements to Play Protect, the Google ecosystem can be increasingly safe, but this does not mean that the chances of downloading an infected app are zero. Safety and antivirus apps are also great, but what if your device is infected already? If your Android device is suddenly slow, uses too much data or displays corrupted data, you could have downloaded an app infected with malware — or ransomware that is much more obvious.\\nSuspicious apps — frequently promising free work software, cheat codes, new games, porn or money — are an increasingly common way of getting viruses on your mobile devices, where they damage and steal data. If you still have access to your Android device, your first step should be to get rid of the infected app before it infects or damages other devices. This is how to locate and remove Android malware and a few security download options that will help protect you in the future.\\nRead more.',\n",

De este modo, los antivirus trabajan con una gran base de datos integrada por los ciberataques que se han desarrollado con anterioridad, al tiempo que también repelen acciones similares en forma o alcance. No obstante, la imaginación de loshackerses proporcional a su capacidad para causar daños, yendo siempre un paso por delante de nuestros escudos pasivos. Por ello, cada vez más empresas apuestan por la protección activa que representan los “cazadores de ciberamenazas”.\\nLa agencia SANS ha publicado un exhaustivo estudio que pasa revista al grado de adopción de estos peculiares “cazadores” en el ámbito corporativo. Un nada desdeñable 43% de las empresas consultadas afirman utilizar con cierta frecuencia este tipo de servicios, al tiempo que un considerable 65% reconocen que invertirán más dinero en ellos en los próximos dos años. ¿Cuál fue el detonante de esta tendencia en ciberseguridad? El propio informe de SANS nos da la respuesta. El 49% de las compañías que participaron en el estudio se encontraron en algún momento con amenazas que sus sistemas de seguridad no podían identificar.\\nCon todo, la actividad de los “cazadores de ciberamenazas” no ha conseguido acabar todavía con algunos errores en materia de seguridadonlinemuy asentados. Por ejemplo, un 37% de las firmas analizadas por SANS no toman ninguna medida relevante hasta que sufren algún ataque. De este modo, la protección proactiva dista de ser un recurso extendido en el tejido empresarial norteamericano, a pesar de que los responsables de las compañías no discuten su interés. Para las grandes empresas, resulta imposible conjurar los riesgos en línea si no disponen de herramientas totalmente adaptadas a su modelo de negocio. La caza de amenazas no puede automatizarse por completo.\\nLos profesionales que se dedican a la caza de ciberamenazas trabajan con un gran número de variables a fin de detectar si están ante un nuevo tipo de ataque o si, simplemente, se trata de un repunte coyuntural de la actividad delictiva. Dentro de este segundo grupo de amenazas encontraríamos el aumento de las acciones durante los periodos en que la empresa registra más operaciones (durante las campañas comerciales, por ejemplo). Los modelos más avanzados de los “cazadores de ciberamenazas” permiten cribar con rapidez los ataques para centrarse en las acciones más peligrosas.\\nVisita nuestro blog con regularidad para seguir el ritmo de las últimas tendencias en ciberseguridad.',\n",

Building a mobile application is not an easy task though.\\nFor iOS, you write code using Objective-C or Swift and for Android, you will find yourself using Java. Apart from different programming languages used to create a mobile that can run on each of the two platforms, the toolchains are entirely different too for both of these mobile platforms.\\nMany modern-day developers use a specific set of technology that is used to build web applications: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are different frameworks that fall under the category commonly known as Hybrid applications. You can use almost one set of source code for developing the application for both iOS and Android platforms.\\nIn recent years, hybrid frameworks have evolved coming from web view to use native APIs. This cross-platform approach of developing a mobile application comes with its own pros and cons. Pros such as being less-time consuming and cost-effective and cons include performance issues.\\nOne great option that falls under the umbrella of cross-platform development is React Native. Developed and used by Facebook as well others such as Tesla, Walmart, Uber Eats, Instagram, Discord, Wix and so on. React Native is based on Facebook’s web library ReactJS.',\n",

API stands forApplication Programming Interface.As the name says, it is an interface with which people — developers, users, and consumers — can interact with data.\\nYou can think of an API as a bartender. You ask the bartender for a drink, and they give you what you want. Simple. So why is that a problem?\\nSince the start of the modern web, building APIs has been easier than it sounds. But learning and understanding APIs was. Developers form the majority of the people that will use your API to build something or consume data. So your API should be as clean and as intuitive as possible. A well-designed API is straightforward to use and learn. It’s also intuitive, an excellent point to remember when you’re starting to design your API.\\nWe’ve been using REST to build APIs for a long time. Along with that come some problems. When making an API using REST design, you’ll face some issues like:\\n1) you’ll have a lot of endpoints;',\n",
